That's called doing your homework.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is poverty. Ignorance is devastation. Ignorance is tragedy. And ignorance is illness. It all stems from ignorance.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>What you don't know will hurt you.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The worst kind of arrogance is arrogance from ignorance.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>There is an ancient script that says, "He that wishes to be ignorant, let him be ignorant." But I took off the last word and it now reads for me like this: He that wishes to be ignorant, let him be!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>There are two parts to influence: First, influence is powerful; and second, influence is subtle. You wouldn't let someone push you off course, but you might let someone nudge you off course and not even realize it.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We need a variety of input and influence and voices. You cannot get all the answers to life and business from one person or from one source.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Attitude is greatly shaped by influence and association.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't spend most of your time on the voices that don't count. Tune out the shallow voices so you will have more time to tune in the valuable ones.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>"No" puts distance between you and the wrong influences.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You must constantly ask yourself these questions: Who am I around? What are they doing to me? What have they got me reading? What have they got me saying? Where do they have me going? What do they have me thinking? And most important, what do they have me becoming? Then ask yourself the big question: Is that okay?<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't join an easy crowd; you won't grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Some people you can afford to spend a few minutes with, but not a few hours.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Get around people who have something of value to share with you. Their impact will continue to have a significant effect on your life long after they have departed.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Be a collector of good ideas, but don't trust your memory. The best collecting place for all of the ideas and information that comes your way is your journal.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The reason why I spend so much money for my journals is to press me to find something valuable to put in them.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>There are three things to leave behind: your photographs, your library, and your personal journals. These things are certainly going to be more valuable to future generations than your furniture!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't use your mind for a filing cabinet. Use your mind to work out problems and find answers; file away good ideas in your journal.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Kids are curious. Kids are watching ants while adults are stepping on them.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>How many languages can a child learn? As many as you will take the time to teach them.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Even kids can get started on becoming financially independent. Kids can make profits long before they can legitimately earn wages.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Of course, kids should pay taxes. Tell little Johnny that if he wants to ride his bicycle on the sidewalk instead of in the mud, he's got to pay three more pennies when he buys a candy bar.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Kids ought to have two bicycles: one to ride and one to rent.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Kids don't lack capacity, only teachers.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>I teach kids how to be rich by the time they are age 40; 35 if they are extra bright. Most kids think they are extra bright, so they go for the 35.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>What should a child do with a dollar? Here's one philosophy: It's only a child and it's only a dollar, so what difference does it make? Wow, what a philosophy! Where do you suppose everything starts for the future? Here's where it starts - it starts with a child and a dollar. You say, "Well, he's only a child once. Let him spend it all." Well, when would you hope that would stop? When he's fifty and broke like you?<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If kids clearly see the promise, they will gladly pay the price.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The challenge of leadership is to be strong, but not rude; be kind, but not weak; be bold, but not a bully; be thoughtful, but not lazy; be humble, but not timid; be proud, but not arrogant; have humor, but without folly.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We must learn to help those who deserve it, not just those who need it. Life responds to deserve, not need.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>My mentor said, "Let's go do it," not "You go do it." How powerful when someone says,<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Good people are found, not changed. Recently, I read a headline that said, "We don't teach our people to be nice. We simply hire nice people." Wow! What a clever short cut.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>A good objective of leadership is to help those who are doing poorly to do well and to help those who are doing well to do even better.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you share a good idea long enough, it will eventually fall on good people.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Leadership is the challenge to be something more than average.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Leaders, whether in the family, in business, in government, or in education, must not allow themselves to mistake intentions for accomplishments.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Learn to help people with more than just their jobs; help them with their lives.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Sometimes those who need it the most are inclined the least.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>In leadership we teach: Don't send your ducks to eagle school because it won't help. Duck finishes eagle school, sees his first rabbit, makes him a friend.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Start with where people are before you try to take them to where you want them to go.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-16.html">16<a/>  </p><p><BR>
