[On promoting recycling] You know, the purpose of all those Moon walks was to take the garbage out.
<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The very success of the human species over eons of time now threatens our extinction. It is the drive that made for success that must now be curbed, redirected or released by expansion into a new world ecology… If we can find people skilful enough to reach the Moon, we sure can find people to solve our environmental problems.
<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
All things are connected. Whatever befalls the earth befalls the children of the earth.
<BR><a href="chief-seattle-quotes.html">Chief Seattle<a/>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The tender ecology of the seashore is being invaded by a host of pollutants that directly threaten marine life.
<BR><B>Edward Wenk</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The use of the sea and air is common to all; neither can a title to the ocean belong to any people or private persons, for as much as neither nature nor public use and custom permit any possession thereof.
<BR><B>Elizabeth I of England</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Willful waste brings woeful want.
<BR><B>Anonymous proverb</B>

<BR><B>Reid A Bryson</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The landscapes were like a violin bow that played upon my soul.
<BR><B>Stendhal</B>
<BR>
<BR>
In the end, we conserve only what we love.  We will love only what we understand.  We will understand only what we are taught.
<BR><B>Baba Dioum</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Conservation cannot be imposed from above.  It must have the support of the people.
<BR><B>Michael Werikhe</B>

<BR><B>Dan J Chabek</B>
<BR>
<BR>
We must give (dolphins) rights as individuals under our laws (with) complete freedom of the waters of the earth.

<BR>
