[On simply giving money to indigenous people and rich kids] If you throw money and not opportunity, if you throw money instead of training, if you throw money instead of education, then you give them a fairly bedded path to destruction.
<BR><a href="andrew-forrest-quotes.html">Andrew Forrest<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Once you remove a persons will by making their life welfare driven, and not opportunity driven then you start to sap that life and in the end you breed great resentment.  
<BR><a href="andrew-forrest-quotes.html">Andrew Forrest<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

Have we advanced so much, when it comes to much more serious subjects?  Human slavery and trafficking, the shock of most is alive and well in practically every nation on earth.
<BR><a href="andrew-forrest-quotes.html">Andrew Forrest<a/>

<BR>
Slavery and lack of proper employment opportunities is not a developing worlds problem, a developed worlds problem, or a third world problem.  It is each and every one of our problems.  It flourishes everywhere lack of employment opportunity exists.
<BR><a href="andrew-forrest-quotes.html">Andrew Forrest<a/>

Health and moral improves and the individuals thirst for further education accompanies a new hunger.  A new hunger for greater success - disparity becomes a memory.  
<BR><a href="andrew-forrest-quotes.html">Andrew Forrest<a/>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Writing a charity cheque on its own doesn’t guarantee a better life for others, but combining it with your leadership definitely will.

<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="andrew-forrest-quotes.html">Andrew Forrest<a/>

In the early days… when we were facing a five billion dollar capital cost… 
<BR><a href="andrew-forrest-quotes.html">Andrew Forrest<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s just that they couldn’t get to the wisdom that energy and the knowledge that people have when they do it day to day.
<BR><a href="andrew-forrest-quotes.html">Andrew Forrest<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There’s something really special, when you put forth an idea that might seem stupid, that could cop some criticism, or might meet some resistance and you push through that character hurdle which is yours – and you take that risk, you step out.  You take that risk and you put forward an idea as brave or as stupid as it may seem.  And we want to acknowledge that guys.  We want to say this is fantastic. 
<BR><a href="andrew-forrest-quotes.html">Andrew Forrest<a/>
<BR>

You wouldn’t do some of these ideas in a normal company… But they’re perfect for Fortescue because of who we are - just an extended large family company.  
<BR><a href="andrew-forrest-quotes.html">Andrew Forrest<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
