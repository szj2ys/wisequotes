<BR>
[On the English channel in 1788]  That most horrid passage.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1790] I have sometimes been suspected of partiality for the preference which I have given to England, but were I to live out of America, that country would have been my choice.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1790] I know very well by experience the strong attractions which England possesses, and should prefer it to any other country that I have seen American excepted.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1794] In a government like that of Great Britain, we know that many abuses exist, both in the governors and governed, but still in no country, America excepted, has there ever existed so great a share of personal liberty and security of property.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1795] England as you know, is the country of my greatest partiality.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1808] The British are very insolent and haughty – and exercise their power, without much regard to right.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I wish to see a mutual spirit of love and goodwill, so honorable to humane nature substituted for that spirit of bitterness which is too much encouraged upon both sides of the Atlantic…
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We live in continual expectation of hostilities.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You would be delighted with the rich verdure of the field, and the high cultivation of the lands.  In the manufactory of many articles the country can boast a superiority over their Galician neighbors.  But when you come to consider the man, and the social affections; ease, civility, and politeness of manners, this people suffer by the comparison.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On England in 1785] They affect to despise the French, and to hate the Americans, of the latter they are very liberal in their proofs.  So great is their pride that they cannot endure to view us as independent, and they fear our growing greatness…
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
<BR>
<BR>
We have native genius, capacity, and ingenuity, … and much more general knowledge diffused amongst us.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We tremble not, either at the sight or name of majesty.  I never felt myself in a more contemptible situation, than when I stood four hours together for a gracious smile from majesty, a witness to the anxious solicitude of those around me for the same mighty boon.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Receive every admonition from your aunt with gratitude.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is said in a good book that in a multitude of counselors there is safety.  I wish it may be found in the counsels of our nation, but at present they look very chaotic to me.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have often wished you were near to me, that I might assist at least by my advice in anything where you might feel as though you wanted age and experience to aid you.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On government officials] As you have been called in providence into the chair of government, you did not accept it without knowing that it had its torments, its trials, its dangers and perplexities.  Look steadfastly at them, arm yourself with patience and forbearance and be not dismayed, and may God and the people support you.  Having put your hand to the plough, you must not look back, nor ought you I think to wish you had not.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Be strict to whatever rules are directed in your studies.  You know how to make yourself beloved.  Attention and diligence and punctuality will not fail to make you esteemed by preceptors and school mates.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On America] She possesses every requisite to render her the happiest country upon the globe.  She has the knowledge and experience of past ages before her.  She was not planted like most other countries with a lawless banditti, or an ignorant savage race who cannot even trace their origin, but by an enlightened, a religious and polished people.

<BR>
The numerous improvements which they [America] have made during a century and a half, in what was then but a howling wilderness, proves their state of civilization.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1785] In England the common people live more comfortably, but there is wretchedness and oppression enough here, to make a wise man mad.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On London in 1785] I believe they have as many spies here as the police of France.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In houses, in furniture, in gardens and pleasure grounds, and in equipage, the wealth of France and English is displayed to a high pitch of grandeur and magnificence; but, the millions who are loaded with taxes to support this pomp and show, I look to my happier country with an enthusiastic warmth, and pray for the continuance of that equality of rank and fortune which forms so large a portion of our happiness.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Is there a dearer name than friend?  Think of it for me.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is a tie more binding than humanity, and stronger than friendship, which makes us anxious for the happiness and welfare of those to whom it binds us.  It makes their misfortunes, sorrows and afflictions our own.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have not forgotten the excellent lessons which I received from my grandmother at a very early period of life.  I frequently think they made a more durable impression upon my mind than those which I received from my own parents.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Wealth, wealth is the only thing that is looked after now.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>

<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The people of our country have a characteristic trait.  Though sometimes misled and deceived, they wish to know what is just and right…
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>

We have passed through one revolution and have happily arrived at the goal, but the ambition, injustice and plunder of foreign powers have again involved us in war, the termination of which is not given us to see.

<BR>
A house divided against itself, and upon that foundation do our enemies build their hopes of subduing us.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have a great cause of thankfulness; that I have lived so long and enjoyed so large a portion of happiness as has been my lot.
