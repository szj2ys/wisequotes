If I have always associated the greatness of science with the greatness of the Fatherland, it is because of the sentiments that you inspired in me.<BR><a href="louis-pasteur-quotes.html">Louis Pasteur<a/><BR><BR>My dear father, whose life was as harsh as your harsh craft, you showed me what patience can accomplish when the task is long.  It is to you that I owe my tenacity in carrying out the work that needs to be done from day to day.
