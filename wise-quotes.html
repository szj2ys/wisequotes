<BR>
We are all… born for a wise purpose.
<BR><a href="p-t-barnum-quotes.html">P T Barnum<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We do not have to wait until we are old to become wise. 
<BR><a href="john-izzo-quotes.html">John Izzo<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Wisdom is the reward you get for a lifetime of listening when you’d have preferred to talk.
<BR><a href="john-izzo-quotes.html">John Izzo<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
An old Navajo told his grandson that sometimes he feels there is a fight that is going on inside him. He said it is a fight between two wolves. One wolf is evil. It is the wolf of anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, superiority, fear of healing my body and mind, fear of succeeding, fear of exploring what has been said by others to be the truth, fear of walking in others’ moccasins and seeing glimpses of their reality through their eyes and their hearts, using empty excuses that my heart knows to be false. The other wolf is good. It is the wolf of joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, empathy, caring for those who have helped me even though their efforts have not always been perfect, the willingness to forgive myself and others, and realising that my destiny is in my hands. The grandson thought about it and asked: ‘But grandfather, which wolf wins?’ His grandfather replied: ‘The wolf that I choose to feed.’

<BR>
<BR>
As I grow older, I pay less attention to what men say. I just watch what they do.
<BR><a href="andrew-carnegie-quotes.html">Andrew Carnegie<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Basically, when you get to my age, you’ll really measure your success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you. I know people who have a lot of money, and they get testimonial dinners and they get hospital wings named after them. But the truth is that nobody in the world loves them. If you get to my age in life and nobody thinks well of you, I don’t care how big your bank account is, your life is a disaster. That’s the ultimate test of how you have lived your life. The trouble with love is that you can’t buy it. You can buy sex. You can buy testimonial dinners. You can buy pamphlets that say how wonderful you are. But the only way to get love is to be loveable. It’s very irritating if you have a lot of money. You’d like to think you could write a check: I’ll buy a million dollars of love. But it doesn’t work that way. The more you give love away, the more you get.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject area) who didn’t read all the time – none, zero. You’d be amazed at how much Warren [Buffett] reads – and how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I’m a book with a couple of legs sticking out.
<BR><a href="charlie-munger-quotes.html">Charlie Munger<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The chief difference between a fool and a wise man is that the wise man learns from his mistakes, while the fool never does.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I hear and I forget.  I see and I remember.  I do and I understand.  
<BR><B>Chinese Proverb</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Wisdom is meaningless until our own experience has given it meaning.
<BR><B>Bergen Evans</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
There are many truths of which the full meaning cannot be realized until personal experience has brought it home.
<BR><B>John Stuart Mill</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Practical wisdom is only to be learned in the school of experience.  Precepts and instructions are useful so far as they go, but, without the discipline of real life, they remain of the nature of theory only.
<BR><B>Samuel Smiles</B>
<BR>
<BR>
You know more of a road by having travelled on it than by all the conjectures and descriptions in the world.
<BR><B>William Hazlitt</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Let no one be deluded that a knowledge of the path can substitute for putting one foot in front of the other.
<BR><B>Mary Caroline Richards</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Wisdom and understanding can only become the possession of individual men by travelling the old road of observation, attention, perseverance, and industry.
<BR><B>Samuel Smiles</B>
<BR>
<BR>
What is the price of experience?  Do men buy it for a song?  Or wisdom for a dance in the street?  No, it is bought with the price of all a man hath, his house, his wife, his children.
<BR><B>William Blake</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Wisdom is found only in truth.
<BR><B>Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Do the thing you know, and you shall learn the truth you need to know.
<BR><B>George MacDonald</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Knowledge conquered by labour becomes a possession – a property entirely our own.
<BR><B>Samuel Smiles</B>
<BR>
<BR>
People respond so well to encouragement, yet most people continue to use criticism in trying to get people to change or do better.  Why don’t they use more encouragement?
<BR><B>Wisdom of a 103 year old</B>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Wisdom is knowledge which has become a part of one’s being…
<BR><B>Orison Swett Marden</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Time ripes all things: no man is born wise.
<BR><B>Miguel De Cervantes</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Knowledge comes but wisdom lingers.
<BR><B>Alfred Lord Tennyson</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers.  It may not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast quantity of facts within a comparatively short time, but the ability to form judgements requires the severe discipline of hard work and the tempering head of experience and maturity.
<BR><B>Calvin Coolidge</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The words printed here are concepts.  You must go through the experiences.
<BR><B>Carl Frederick</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The experience gathered from book, though often valuable, is but the nature of learning: whereas the experience gained from actual life is of the nature of wisdom…
<BR><B>Samuel Smiles</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Knowledge can be communicated. But wisdom cannot.  A man can find it, he can live it, he can be filled and sustained by it, but he cannot utter or teach it.
<BR><B>Hermann Hesse</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The universe is one great kindergarten for man.  Everything that exists has brought with it its own peculiar lesson.  The mountain teaches stability and grandeur; the ocean immensity and change.  Forests, lakes, and rivers, clouds and winds, stars and flowers, stupendous glaciers and crystal snowflakes, - every form of animate or inanimate existence, leaves its impress upon the soul of man.  Even the bee and ant have brought their little lessons of industry and economy.
<BR><B>Orison Swett Marden</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Who is a wise man?  He who learns of all men.
<BR><B>The Talmud</B>
<BR>
<BR>
If you wish to know the road up the mountain, ask the man who goes back and forth on it.
<BR><B>Zenrin</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Follow then the shining ones, the wise, the awakened, the loving, for they know how to work and forbear.
<BR><B>Gautama Buddha</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Knowing others is wisdom.  Knowing yourself is superior wisdom.
<BR><B>Lao-Tzu</B>
<BR>
<BR>
When the student is ready, the teacher appears.
<BR><B>Chinese proverb</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The fool tells me his reasons.  The wise man persuades me with my own.
<BR><B>Aristotle</B>
<BR>
<BR>
A wise man should consider that health is the greatest of human blessings, and learn how by his own thought to derive benefit from his illnesses.
<BR><B>Hippocrates</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Water is the only drink for a wise man.
<BR><B>Henry David Thoreau</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Wise men think twice before speaking once. 
<BR><a href="napoleon-hill-quotes.html">Napoleon Hill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
All things are connected. Whatever befalls the earth befalls the children of the earth.
<BR><a href="chief-seattle-quotes.html">Chief Seattle<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Touch not the poisonous firewater that makes wise men turn to fools and robs the spirit of its vision.
<BR><B>Tecumseh</B>
<BR>
<BR>
No man is wise enough by himself. 
<BR><B>Plautus</B>
<BR>
