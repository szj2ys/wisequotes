All you need is a laptop or a PC and an internet connection and you can pretty much do almost anything and create almost any type of company.  
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2013] When you own a professional sports team it doesn’t take long to realize that owning a team is unlike owning any other business.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2013] The Mavs are a business. I want to make a profit. But unlike every other business, making the most money possible is not a driving motivation. I try to recognize that Mav’s fans aren’t only about wins and losses.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There are fans who love the Mavs because it makes their lives better.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2013] College is where you find out about yourself. It’s where you learn how to learn.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I truly thought that the markets were efficient… The reason I was ready to try was that it was patently obvious that the market wasn’t efficient.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I get asked every day to invest in private companies. I always ask the same couple questions. How soon till I get my money back, and how much cash can I make from the investment? I never ask what the PE ratio will be, what the Price to Sales ratio will be. Most private investors are the same way.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2012] Defining engagement by clicks, likes, shares, unlikes and reporting works for Google’s search engine, I don’t believe it works for a social network.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2012] FB is a fascinating destination that is an amazing alternative to boredom which excels in its SIMPLICITY. One of the threats in any business is that you outsmart yourself. FB has to be careful of just that.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012] As a long time investor, I have never turned down an investment because of tax rates. I was just as successful investing when capital gains were much higher. I was just as successful investing when individual tax rates were much higher.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012] No smart investor turns down a good deal because of tax rates.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012] I’m investing in companies as fast as I can to help add to the economy and create jobs. But we can’t let our desperation to create jobs blind us from the exact problems that put our economy in this position.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2008] If you can borrow cheap money, invest in some asset that can be marked to an increasing market, borrow against the gain and buy something else and do it as many times as possible, wouldn’t you ?
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2008] Investors should be rewarded for actually owning companies and gaining returns on their investments. Financial engineers should have to pay a premium for the risk they introduce to the entire financial system.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2008] It was not investors that brought on the last 2 crashes. It was the financial engineers.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2008] Its hard to financial engineer a private company.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012] The only people who know what business Wall Street is in are the high frequency and automated traders.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012] A hacker wants to jump in front of your shopping cart and grab your credit card and then sell it. A high frequency trader wants to jump in front of your trade and then sell that stock to you. A hacker will tell you that they are serving a purpose by identifying the weak links in your system. A trader will tell you they deserve the pennies they are making on the trade or the rebate they are getting from the exchange because they provide liquidity to the market.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012] Wall Street is no longer serving the purpose what it was designed to . Wall Street was designed to be a market to which companies provide securities (stocks/bonds), from which they received capital that would help them start/grow/sell businesses.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I started actively trading stocks in 1992. 
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012] There is value to trading automation. It is here to stay. There is absolutely NO VALUE to High Frequency Trading. None. We need to bring our markets back to their original goals of creating capital for business.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2008] Entrepreneurs who create something out of nothing don’t care what tax rates are.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Entrepreneurs live to be entrepreneurs.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Entrepreneurs live for the juice of making their dreams come true.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2012] Companies struggle to keep up with all the changes the latest in digital technology requires. Train people and they will hire them.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2012] Mobile is going to crush Facebook.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2012] I bought 150k shares of FB. 50k shares at 33, 50k shares at 31.97 and 50k shares around 32.50. Its a trade, not an investment. Kind of like buying a Mickey Mantle, a Hank Aaron and a Barry Bonds Rookie Card knowing there is a card show in town next week.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] If you really want to know where you destiny lies, look at where you apply your time.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] When you work hard at something you become good at it.  When you become good at doing something, you will enjoy it more.  When you enjoy doing something, there is a very good chance you will become passionate or more passionate about it.  When you are good at something, passionate and work even harder to excel and be the best at it, good things happen.  Don’t follow your passions, follow your effort.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] All of us can learn to accept everyone.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] I have come to realize, intellectually, that I personally don’t give a sh*t about your sex life, your spiritual life, your personal life, whatever. I have no problem with you being you. I accept who you are.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] I like who I am. I love my life. But that doesn’t mean I won’t always try to be a better version of me.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012] I love that SharkTank is killing it!
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012] The pressure in the SharkTank is off the charts. The Sharks feel it. The entrepreneurs feel it and sometimes get caught up in it. That sometimes leads the entrepreneurs to “embellish” details of their business. This is why we do due diligence after the show.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012] The Big Lie = Online video views is the same as number of TV viewers.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012] Big media is not as stupid as they used to be.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011] No matter what year you were born, by the time you finish(ed) high school, its (was) a completely different world.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2011] Bust your ass and get rich.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2011] When you make a sh*tload of money. Do something positive with it.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If I Can Do It, You Can Do It.
