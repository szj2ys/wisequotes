<BR>
<BR>
I started with zero.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Pat [Sarich] and I are both very simple in our desires.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 1973 on making quite a killing buying and selling land in Western Australia during the mining boom.]  Without the money from land sales, I could never have financed the orbital-engine project.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1973 on the engine being called the ‘Orbital Engine’ and not the ‘Sarich Engine’.] I really don’t want my name plastered everywhere.  
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 1973] I’ve been embarrassed by some of the claims made for the engine.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 1976] I tended to get a bit carried away…
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 1989] We believe many manufacturers will be caught… with their pants down…
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 1989 on why he took manufacturing to the US.] I could not get a comparable deal in Australia.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
That is pioneering.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We had no experience in engine development.  We had to learn to test our engines and develop our own facilities.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I personally never received anything from the Government…
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007 on investing some of his fortune in the development of alternative energy sources.] There’s a real energy crisis looming for the world, not to mention the carbon problems, the greenhouse and all that.  So if you could come up with some sort of solution or at least make an attempt to develop something along the right lines, then it would do the world community a service.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007 on alternative fuels] It’s an area that I really like.  I think there’s great potential in it.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his son Peter Sarich in 2007 after selling four of their commercial properties to US giant GE Real Estate for $500 million.] He’s a lot better than I am.  I’m not kidding.  He knows a lot more about real estate than I do.  My main value to Peter is that he’s got someone to bounce things off and everyone needs that.  We’re a very good team.  It’s not just like father and son, we’re good mates.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007 on the idea to create energy by passing water over hot, dry rocks up to seven kilometres below the earth’s surface and using the heated water to generate power.] There’s no guarantee [and] there are considerable technical difficulties, but if you could successfully accomplish that it is a very good way to go.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] They talk abut the waste from the nuclear plants being a big problem but, gee whiz, you look at what the fossil fuels are doing.  They’ll start melting down the ice caps, which is already worse than scientists originally thought, and that will be catastrophic.  Nuclear is dangerous too, but you’ve got to look at the better of all evils.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007 on his brother’s advice to retire to a golf course.] I really feel that it’s a waste of your brain. 
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007 on his idea of retirement was being able to work] Almost at your discretion.  I’d call that retirement because previously you have no choice.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I started with zero.  In fact, I had a severe car accident just before I got married so when we married we had to first of all pay off all our debts and then come from there.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] My wife was a bookkeeper and I was an engineer and we both had two jobs for a long time.  We’ve known each other since we were 16.  We were a bit casual for a while but then we got serious after I nearly killed myself in a car.

<BR>
<BR>
I used to do a h*ll of a lot of jogging and people would say, don’t you get bored?  But I used it as a time to think.  I’d set my mind on a problem or something I want to do and 45 minutes later you’re finished.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m very keen on dogs, and kelpies are just brilliant, intelligent animals.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The reason I haven’t got another dog yet is simply that in town it’s a little bit hard.  My wife and I, Pat, we’re both mad on getting another dog but it would have to be another kelpie.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1973 on high level business negotiations.] No, I’ve never been nervous about this.  I have been a businessman before, you know.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1973] I enjoy engineering much better, but I don’t mind the business side.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1973] To tell you the truth, I’ve met a lot of top academics since all this business and very few of them have impressed me.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1973 on his wife Pat Sarich] Without her personality I couldn’t have done it.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1973 on the more trendy and unruly appearance of a couple of young male employees.] It’s what their work’s like that counts.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1973 on the engine being called the ‘Orbital Engine’ and not the ‘Sarich Engine’.] I really don’t want my name plastered everywhere.  Anyway, a year should see me out of that company.  When all this is over I’ll pull out as an active partner and return to research.  I’m quite happy working 12 hours a day at that sort of thing.  I have other ideas.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1973] I don’t worry about money.  It doesn’t control my thoughts.  But I’ve never really been without it.  I don’t think like that.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being a business executive at Tutt Bryant.] I was a bit soft, although I remember a time when I had to sack a chap.  He was on the bottle and he’d go to pubs when he was sent out on jobs.  The first time he gave me a heartbreak story about his wife and children and asked for another chance.  I fell for it.  Next time I found him in the pub myself and sacked him.  It was hard, but I had to do it.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1973] If I do get wealthy, our main thought will be to stop the kids being spoilt.  We should be all right, Pat and I are both very simple in our desires.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1973 on driving a gadgety Fairlane and his wife a new yellow Renault GL] Some companies have been generous lately.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I can’t remember ever voting Liberal.  I usually tend to go either for the Country Party or Labor.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1973 on having worked like a demon the last two years.] I remember one Christmas Eve we worked all night and then I went to sleep during Christmas dinner at the in-laws’ place.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The one place I’d like to go is England and that’s the place where no one has asked me to go.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Time will tell.  The engine still has to be proved.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 1973] I’ve been embarrassed by some of the claims made for the engine.  Some of the stories in the US in particular have been badly twisted.  Claims by other people have been attributed to me.  
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the engine compared to a piston engine in January 1973.  Main advantages being its small size, lower cost and high power-to-weight ratio many times greater than conventional piston engines and] Much, much smoother.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 1973] The engine we are concentrating mostly on at the moment will develop between 150 and 200 horsepower.  It is only 17 inches in diameter and has a total length of 9 ½ inches.  In prototype form, it weighs 87 pounds without accessories, and should weigh around 120 pounds fully equipped.
