I protect myself by being flexible.  I never get too attached to one deal or one approach.  For starters, I keep a lot of balls in the air, because most deals fall out, no matter how promising they seem at first.  In addition, once I’ve made a deal, I always come up with at least a half dozen approaches to making it work, because anything can happen, even to the best-laid plans.

<BR>
It has been said that I believe in the power of positive thinking.  In fact, I believe in the power of negative thinking.  I happen to be very conservative in business.  I always go into the deal anticipating the worst.  If you plan for the worst – if you can live with the worst – the good will always take care of itself.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It never stops, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.  I try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present.  That’s where the fun is.  And if it can’t be fun, what’s the point?

<BR>
I’m just looking to hire the best talent, wherever I can find it.

<BR>
One point is to listen to your gut, no matter how good something sounds on paper.  The second is that you’re generally better off sticking with what you know.  And the third is that sometimes your best investments are the ones you don’t make.

From as early as I can remember, my father would say to me, ‘The most important thing in life is to love what you’re doing, because that’s the only way you’ll ever be really good at it.’
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I ask my executive assistant and the person who keeps my life organized, to bring me lunch: a can of tomato juice.  I rarely go out, because mostly it’s a waste of time.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Some people have a sense of the market and some people don’t.  Steven Spielberg has it.  Lee Iacocca of Chrysler has it, and so does Judith Krantz in her way.  Woody Allen has it for the audience he cares about reaching, and so does Sylvester Stallone, at the other end of the spectrum.  Some people criticize Stallone, but you’ve got to give him credit.  I mean, here’s a man who is just 41 years old, and he’s already created two of the all-time great characters, Rocky and Rambo.  To me he’s a diamond-in-the-rough type, a genius purely by instinct.  He know’s what the public wants and he delivers it.

I have at least a dozen meetings.  The majority occur on the spur of the moment, and few of them last longer than fifteen minutes.

One of the keys to thinking big is total focus.  I think of it almost as a controlled neurosis, which is a quality I’ve noticed in many highly successful entrepreneurs.  They’re obsessive, they’re driven, they’re single-minded and sometimes they’re almost maniacal, but it’s all channelled into their work.  Where other people are paralysed by neurosis, the people I’m talking about are actually helped by it.

When I got no answer and a few more months had gone by, I wrote again and said I’d love to drop by and see him again.  More time passed, and I wrote another letter, suggesting a whole new way to make the deal.  I was relentless, even in the face of a total lack of encouragement, because much more often than you’d think, sheer persistence is the difference between success and failure.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I like to think I have that instinct.  That’s why I don’t hire a lot of number-crunchers, and I don’t trust fancy marketing surveys.  I do my own surveys and draw my own conclusions.  I’m a great believer in asking everyone for an opinion before I make a decision.  It’s a natural reflex.  If I’m thinking of buying a piece of property, I’ll ask the people who live nearby about the area – what they think of the schools and the crime and the shops.  When I’m in another city and I take a cab, I’ll always make it a point to ask the cab-driver questions.  I ask and I ask and I ask, until I begin to get a gut feeling about something.  And that’s when I make a decision.

<BR>
Sometimes – not often, but sometimes – less is more.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it.  That makes the other guy smell blood, and then you’re dead.  The best thing you can do is deal from strength, and leverage is the biggest strength you can have.  Leverage is having something the other guy wants.  Or better yet, needs.  Or best of all, simply can’t do without.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>

<BR>
There is no typical week in my life.  I wake up most mornings very early, around six, and spend the first hour or so of each day reading the morning newspapers.  I usually arrive at my office by nine, and I get on the phone.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I like thinking big.  I always have.  To me it’s very simple: if you’re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.  Most people think small, because most people are afraid of success, afraid of making decisions, afraid of winning.  And that gives people like me a great advantage.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>

<BR>
It’s not how many hours you put in, it’s what you get done while you’re working.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In the end, you’re measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Time is more valuable than money, because if you run out of money, you can start over again.  But when you’re run out of time, there’s no starting over.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>

We are responsible for our own luck.
