Buying properties is a numbers game.

I probably work as hard as, if not harder than, most.  But in terms of receiving a wage slip or a salary payment from an employer, I have no experience of that.

Property is very forgiving of mistakes.

<BR>
<BR>
It astounds me that people will spend more time, read more reports, compare more options, drive more miles, and talk with more sellers when looking for a new car that will cost money and depreciate during the few brief years of ownership than they will spend looking for an investment property that will appreciate and feed them forever.
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The biggest reason why I buy property is to acquire debt, for the simple reason that the amount of debt stays the same, but the asset against which that debt is secured goes up in value.
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The secret is to do your homework, get the courage of your convictions, and then dare to try.  You will either win, or learn.  And you never learn less.

Ask most people on their retirement what their greatest asset is, and the vast majority will answer that it is their home… In nearly all cases it is their home, and you will hear the lament of many retirees who reflect and say: ‘If only we had bought two properties when we bought this one!’

You are limited only by your imagination.
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the things I love about real estate is that once you have purchased a property, you can do many things to increase its value way more than the cost of making the improvement.  What a perfect vehicle for turning thoughts into money – creating something out of nothing.  This is the ultimate in alchemy.

[On his study (whilst at University) over 7 months on rich people] The rich either made their wealth, or kept their wealth, in real estate.

<BR>
Successful investing!
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I tell people that property is not just as good as other investments, not just a little better, and not even just a lot better than other investments, but tens or even hundreds of times better than other investments, most people do not believe it.
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When you buy property, you generally have banks and other lending institutions falling over themselves to give you money.
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Is it not possible that the property for which you just paid $1 million using your $100,000 cash and a mortgage of $900,000 is worth $1.5 million, and that some slow-thinking owner of agent let you get away with paying too little for it?  Is it not possible that you bought a phenomenal bargain?  Of course it is!
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most people would rather rot in front of the television set than pick up a paintbrush and paint a $20,000 profit for themselves in a couple of days…
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Perception is reality!
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Whereas most other investments do not offer significant leverage, property offers tremendous leverage through the generous application of mortgage financing.  What’s more unlike with other investments, you can often buy properties at prices significantly below their value, you can do things to them to further increase their value way beyond the cost of the improvement, and you do not need to seel to reap huge benefits from the increase in value.
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Gearing is readily available to property investors, and rarely available to investors in other asset classes.
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Consider all the properties you have ever owned.  And then consider all the properties your relatives and friends have ever owned.  Have you ever known one to plummet in value by 60 percent, 90 percent, or even disappear off your balance sheet entirely?
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Always compare apples with apples!
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Never underestimate the benefits of depreciation in property!
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Property is very tax-friendly.
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On property averages] If I put one of your feet in a bucket of ice, and the other one in a bucket of boiling water, and told you that on average you must be about right, you would have a problem with me.  It is not enough to just consider the average!
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
House prices tend to go up in tandem with their peers…
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies come and go, but the buildings they work out of, and the homes that the workers live in, tend to stay around for a long time.
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People are perversely obsessed with investing in their own town or city or area, when sometimes it would make much more sense to invest elsewhere.
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Property… is relaxed, laid-back, solid, consistent, and sure.  I did not say ‘slow-but-sure’… But you do not have to work it every nail-biting moment of the day.
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Having fears when considering investing in real estate is natural.  But letting that fear drive you is not productive.  Developing the financial intelligence to be able to discern a good deal from a mediocre one, on the other hand, is wise.
<BR><a href="dolf-de-roos-quotes.html">Dolf de Roos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You do not need much of the purchase price in cash to buy a property.
