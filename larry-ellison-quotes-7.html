<BR>
<BR>
Often we’re just conforming to some fashion… Because we just want to be accepted and loved.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The ability to think, the ability to reason… What works and what doesn’t.  What’s fair and what isn’t.  What’s right and what’s wrong.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When fashion and the pursuit of love is in conflict with reason, too often, fashion in the pursuit of love wins.  In my case it didn’t.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I started working part-time programming.  And I found in a very short period of time that I could make more money writing programs than a ten year professor at Chicago was making.  And I was a teenager, and I said ‘This is cool.’  It was also fun.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was a game.  It was like working on puzzles.  So I enjoyed it and it paid extremely well.  I could work at home, I could work my own hours.  I closely associated with computers because they were absolutely a slave to reason and nothing about fashion.  They were completely logical.  I enjoyed spending time with them.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On working with computers.] It was very profitable.  It was very creative.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I figured out very, very quickly that rather than being paid by the hour I was much better off being paid by the program.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On competitors.] We just say – we can do this and they can’t.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On comparing Oracle products with competitors in advertising.] Fact based advertising.  We say very clearly that we’re faster, and we’re more reliable and these tests prove it.  Even if the facts are true, it’s considered a little bit rude by some people.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People like to work with other intelligent and interesting people who like to do interesting things.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Oracle’s pay scales.] We are the highest paying company in Silicon Valley.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his role and his employees roles at Oracle.] Their job, my job is to build better products than the competition.  Then sell those products in the marketplace.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2013] Eventually supplant Microsoft and then move from being number 2 to being number 1.  That is our reason for being.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly we hit a wall.  We hit $1 billion in revenue and we were having serious management issues all over the place.  And the people who were running the billion dollar company were the same people who that were running it when we were a $15 million company 1/20 of the size.  And I had an incredible sense of loyalty to those people who worked with me to build Oracle.  And it was a very painful realization, in 1990 that I was going to have to change the management team.  That the company had outgrown the management.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s an entirely different skill set from running a $15 million company to running a billion dollar company.  Both skill sets are rare and precious.  
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Think things out for yourself.  Come to your own judgements.  Don’t simply conform to conventional ways of thinking, conventional ways of dressing, conventional ways of acting.  A lot of things are based on fashion.  Even morality at times is based on fashion.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2013] Slavery was once considered not to be immoral.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People are shocked that the ancient Greeks had slaves.  That we had slavery in this country as recently as 130, 140 years ago.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You really have to go back to first principles and think things out for yourself.  Look at the scientific principles or the moral principles.  Or business ideas or product ideas.  You have to think things out for yourself.    
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the American Dream.] The opportunity in this country is outstanding.  Everyone who works hard, maybe a little cleverly, has the opportunity to make almost anything possible.  
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
That’s the American Dream – that anything here is possible.  We are not held back, that immigrants come here and in a single generation do extraordinary things.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On American in February 2013] This country is not perfect, but compare it to any other country in the world and it’s absolutely fabulous.  There is unlimited opportunity, but it requires hard work.  Requires a little bit of luck.  But still, in America, anything is possible.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2006] I’ve run engineering since Day One, and I still run engineering.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Safra Catz in 2006 saying ‘I don’t know who would take over if something happened to Larry.  I don’t want the job.’] She’s seen what fame and fortune bring, and she’s not impressed.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2006 on Oracle succession plans.] It is silly to think you can groom someone. Jack Welch didn't have a successor. If you want to put me in his league, by all means, guilty as charged.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2006] Life is short. I'm not going to spend every minute of it with Oracle
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2006] Wall Street is often the last to know.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[As a student] A Latin teacher once told me that the 'F' she gave me would ruin my life. I didn't believe it and told her so. A little letter in a square box? It all seemed so silly.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2006] Our applications engineering team is twice as big as it used to be. And it's not just size, it's the experience they have of being first. Banking, telecom and government. We weren't first before we bought these companies.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2006] I'm a major in-the-moment person.  If this is what I'm doing now, I'm not going to be lusting for the next day or something that's going to happen two weeks from now. I'm just going to enjoy what's happening now
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Oracle in September 1998.] We were profitable from day one. Then in 1990 we hit the wall and had a $28.7 million loss quarter.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1998] Our goal was growth… Every year we were a year older and twice as large. We doubled all the way up to $500 million, then slowed to 60 percent growth. And every year, people said, Larry, you should stop trying to grow so fast. I mean, how insane.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1998] The larger risk was in growing too slow.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We aggressively pursued the market and growth because we thought we had to get up to a certain scale to survive the shake-up in the computer industry.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We certainly wanted to win every deal, win every game. We wanted to be the Miami Dolphins, have a 100-percent winning season.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1998] The way you grow from a billion dollars to three billion dollars, which is our goal now, is not to sell big deals or convince someone to buy software in advance. The only way we can grow today is to convince major companies like Texaco to be a partner. 
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1998] People invest a small fortune - a large fortune! - in their computing infrastructure. But they still can't get the information they need out of their computers. Some stuff is on one computer, other stuff is on another computer.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1998 in response to the statement ‘Don’t parallel machines pose very sticky software problems?’] That's conventional thinking… . It's like playing chess and being black and always copying white's moves. What a sure-fire way to lose!
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Find where everyone else is doing this wrong, where you can do it differently and better.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1998.] Sales guys offer tremendous leverage for the company. They are the highest-paid guys in the company and the least automated.
