Inventing is only one of my lines.  I am also a bank director, a president of companies, a fisherman, an author, an engineer, a cook, a naturalist, a stockholder, a consultant, and a dock-walloper.  Whenever anyone asks me what I am, I become rather confused, because I don’t know which one of these occupations to give.  ‘To be perfectly honest,’ I told a young friend, ‘I am best described as just a guy with a very large bump of curiosity and a gambling instinct.’

They hauled the fish in hand over hand - mighty slow, hard work.  ‘Isn’t there an easier way of doing that?’ we asked.  The fisherman shook their heads.  That was the way the snappers had always been caught in the Gulf by them and their fathers and grandfathers.  Consequently, they figured that was the only way to catch them.

[On noticing a lot of muskrats near a farm where he holidayed on at Long Island] When I was about 10 years old, I was casting around for ways to raise money to buy a shotgun, and I thought of the muskrats.  So I wrote a letter to Dr. William T. Hornaday, and asked him if the zoo was in the market for live muskrats.  Dr. Hornaday replied that the zoo didn’t need any muskrats, but he gave me the name of an English lord who would pay $1 apiece for 12 live ‘rats’ with which to stock estate.  That was a real opportunity.
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I trapped 12 fine specimens and shipped them to his lordship.  Three of the rats died en route but the others survived and I collected $9 with which I bought a fine single-barreled shotgun.  My curiosity about muskrats paid off.  I was embarked on the path of free enterprise.

<BR>
<BR>
My curiosity led me to another small gold mine…
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I kept very quiet, thought, about my enterprises as a frog entrepreneur and rat merchant, for I was afraid of being kidded by my fellow students.
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

When the war closed these markets, fur prices crashed and it looked as though all fur traders in the North would be ruined.
