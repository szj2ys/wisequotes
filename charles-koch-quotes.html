My father, Fred C Koch, born in 1900, saw little future in Quanah or the printing business.  He left to study engineering…
<BR><a href="charles-koch-quotes.html">Charles Koch<a/>

My father stressed the importance of humility as well as hard work.  When I arrived in Wichita, his first words to me were: ‘I hope your first deal is a loser, otherwise you will think you’re a lot smarter than you are.’  He had nothing to worry about – I got us in plenty of losers.
<BR><a href="charles-koch-quotes.html">Charles Koch<a/>

<BR>
<BR>
My father carried on the engineering business by forming Koch Engineering in 1945.  It was two-thirds owned by my brothers and me, and one-third by Harry Litwin, it’s president.  In 1954, Harry Litwin agreed to take the engineering business and form his own company while Koch Engineering retained the Flexitray business.
<BR><a href="charles-koch-quotes.html">Charles Koch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As the growth of our crude oil gathering business accelerated, my father’s fragile health deteriorated.  In 1966 he made me president of Rock Island so that, as he put it, if something happened to him I would be in charge.  In May of 1967 he had a severe heart attack and another, in November, which was fatal.  We renamed Rock Island in his honor, and our company has been known as Koch Industries ever since.  I was blessed to work with my father for six years until his death… At age 32, I succeeded him as chairman and CEO.
<BR><a href="charles-koch-quotes.html">Charles Koch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Our willingness to move quickly, absorb more risk and give better service enabled us to become the leading crude oil gathering company.
