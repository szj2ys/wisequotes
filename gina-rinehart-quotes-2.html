<BR>
Do you know that in 1933 two out of three people in Western Australia voted for secession?  The whole movement died down after that…
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t like our state rights being grabbed by Canberra.  I think our movement will get very strong, especially now with inflation, unemployment, rising taxes.  
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her father] We both love the bush.  It’s Dad’s stomping ground.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
He’s a wonderful father.  Strict, when he wants to be – he’ll stand no nonsense – but we have always been very close friends.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
His grooming, his education for my eventually taking over the responsibility of his interests began when I was about 12.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Does the prospect of taking over from him frighten me?  Well it would if I hadn’t been prepared.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I can’t say I have anything yet to match my father’s knowledge of mining, but I’m willing to learn.  
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On learning about mining in her youth] I’m vitally interested which is most of the battle.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When we take special guests up to see the mines, I’m delegated to show them around and answer the questions.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As my father’s daughter – and he’s a very exciting man – I love being behind him all the way.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1975] We are going to build our own home.  We are allowing 12 months for the project.  We don’t want to rush into things and make mistakes we will have to live with.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We have our relaxing moments.  Greg things dancing is a waste of energy which is a shame.  But we love squash, enjoy our times up around the mines, on the properties, riding and swimming.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We love having friends to dinner, going to the pictures and of course, plays – they are our favourite.  When we go abroad, we see every one in New York and London.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We just don’t like standing around at cocktail parties – none of us drink anyway.  It’s not that we have anything against such do’s, they are just not for us.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I love clothes and buy most of them from the one shop in Perth which seems to have everything I like.  No, we don’t have shares in the place.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her 21st birthday party to be held in the garden of their home in Dalkeith, Perth] Dad wanted to have it in a hotel but I held out for home.  It’s so much warmer.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
 [On inviting Gough Whitlam to her 21st birthday party] We asked Mr Whitlam but he couldn’t come.  He sent a very sweet telegram explaining that it was difficult because Parliament was opening at the time.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Dad’s not a speech giver.  He showed a television film which was made about him some time ago and then asked for questions.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m very, very proud of Dad.  I think the world of him.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her first child] If I’m an unfrustrated person, then I’m an unworried mother.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
[In 1976] I know that I've got an awful lot of work to do so that I can carry on the work my father has been doing.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1976] It's not just me, we have staff of course to help but it's just that I am the only child, so a lot of it does come my way.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1976] All I can do is devote all my time to the business side and to my family and everything else I sort of forget about.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[More on her husband Frank Rinehart in 1997] My husband, Frank Rinehart was a very private person...
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her husband Frank Rinehart] He was actually a very, very modest person. I don't know until after he passed away that he had in fact... a friend of his mentioned it to me - that he'd in fact become top of Harvard College and top of Harvard Law School.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997] Dad went through a very, very difficult time and you know the sad part is, I was only there, properly there in the last few months, and I saw that Dad had very few people around him that he could trust.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997] There was nothing in the estate for a fight later on because he'd disposed of, or given away most of whatever, most of the things in his lifetime, so there's nothing left in the estate to fight about.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2002 on the coroner inquest into her father’s death] We are going to need time to review his findings to get a better understanding of his findings and after that I'd like to make a public comment.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997] It was my father who made all this possible for us. He was the one that found it. He's the one that gave me the early confidence even though he wasn't here to follow through with it, much as he'd love to be.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997] I am terribly fortunate my oldest son John and I have a very, very good relationship. We enjoy each other’s company, I certainly like his mind, I like his comments on things.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is a family company, it's owned entirely by the children and myself and ultimately it is in his interest to learn more about the company so that if anything happens to mother, there'll be him and also staff members to, you know, to try and keep things going.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The last five years in particular I’ve found it very, very difficult at times. There have been, you know, a lot of pressures and a lot of strains and stresses, so yes, there have been times that, you know, I felt things extremely difficult.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think the contribution my father's made to Western Australia and indeed even Australia has been absolutely unique and extraordinary and I don’t think it’s a contribution that is recognised as much as it should be. 
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Our family just for generations has been a pastoralist family up here. My father was the first one who went from the pastoralist scene into the mining industry and I'm the next generation after that and my children are interested in the north too because they've also had experiences up here from babyhood.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t think I was wrong when I said what I said and that was that I felt dad was close to perfect.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You know, as a father he was a a very excellent father.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I guess what I shouldn’t have said was how he was fat because (laughs) now I can just imagine my children saying that about me.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My father and I were very, very close. I was the only child and dad seemed to be rather pleased… he was pleased to have a child.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her father] We spent an inordinate amount of time together.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
This was our original homestead at Mulga Downs, this is where I spent my earlier years, but unfortunately it's no longer with us today because it was demolished in a cyclone and as you can see the station just uses it now to put windmill parts on.
