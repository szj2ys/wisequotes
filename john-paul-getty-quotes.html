The meek shall inherit the earth, but not the mineral rights.

<BR>
<BR>
There’s a lot of room at the top.  This symbolic Millionaire’s Club has an unlimited number of vacant seats to fill on its membership roster.  I’m afraid that if these seats are not filled more quickly, it is because young potential candidates, who are very qualified, give up the fight before it really begins.

<BR>
Money is like fertilizer.  You have to spread it around everywhere, if not it stinks.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Money is a wonderful commodity to have, but the more one possesses, the more involved and complicated become his dealings and relationships with people.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The businessman who goes against the current of popular opinion should expect to be opposed, derided and damned.  That’s what made me rich!

<BR>
<BR>
There are a thousand men who want security for every one man who is willing to take risks.

<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I made my first million from the front seat of a Model T Ford, which I had bought second hand.  The car was my head office, and general headquarters for my work sites.  It was sometimes even my hotel room.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you owe the bank $100 that’s your problem.  If you owe the bank $100 million, that’s the bank’s problem.

My formula for success is rise early, work late, and strike oil.
<BR>Rise early. Work late. Strike oil.

<BR>
<BR>
In business or out of it, there’s nothing unusual or shameful about making a mistake – once.  But… to stumble twice against the same stone is a proverbial disgrace.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The man who comes up with a means for doing or producing almost anything better, faster or more economically has his future and his fortune at his fingertips.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The individual who wants to reach the top in business must appreciate the might of the force of habit – and must understand that practices are what create habits.  He must be quick to break those habits that can break him – and hasten to adopt those practices that will become the habits that help him achieve the success he desires.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There are always opportunities through which businessmen can profit handsomely if they will only recognize and seize them…
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To succeed in a business, to reach the top, an individual must know all it is possible to know about that business.

<BR>
<BR>
If you can calculate how much you have, then you are not a billionaire!
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The man going into business for himself also needs sufficient capital, but this is the least important factor.  Just as a bad workman invariably complains that he has bad tools, so the bad businessman always wails that he does not have enough capital.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Go and work in a large company; it’s like getting on a train.  You’re always asking yourself if it is you or the train that’s moving at a hundred miles an hour.

Once in the game, I always try to hit the ball back, and do my best to beat the opponent!

A business person who goes against the grain of current public opinion has to expect opposition; he or she will be made fun of, and often slandered.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I most certainly was not born a businessman.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If all the money and property in the world were divided up equally at, say, 3 o’clock in the afternoon, by 3.30pm there would already be notable differences in the financial conditions of the recipients.  Within that first 30 minutes, some adults would have lost their share.  Some would have gambled theirs away and some would have been swindled or cheated out of their portion (thereby making some others richer).  The disparity would increase with growing momentum as time went on.  After 90 days, the differences would be staggering.  And, I’m willing to wager that, within a year or two at the most, the distribution of wealth would conform to patterns almost identical with those that had previously prevailed.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A hatred of failure has always been part of my nature and, I suppose, one of the more pronounced motivating forces in my life.  It is not that I love success for its own sake.  However, once I have committed myself to any undertaking, a powerful inner drive cuts in and I become intent on seeing it through to a satisfactory conclusion.  In most fields of endeavour, I have been successful more often than not.  When my efforts resulted in failure, I did everything possible to ensure that my mistakes were not repeated.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I resolved to proceed on a large scale of massive high-priced purchases, and to build an independent petroleum enterprise.  My friends and acquaintances – to say nothing of my competitors – thought that my buying binge constituted a fatal error.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
All of a sudden I realized that I’d covered a lot of ground towards achieving the goal I had set myself, and which I had undertaken in September of 1914.  I had established the base for my own business in the American petroleum industry.  I wasn’t quite 24 years old, but I had become a successful independent petroleum dealer.  And I’d made my first million.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To become a billionaire, you have to have the mentality of a billionaire.  This particular state of mind concentrates all knowledge and intelligence on a single and unique goal.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Usually most people I know disagree with almost all the projects, but when I announced my intention to buy and build at Revolcadero Beach, the reaction was for once unanimous: Impossible!  The reasons they found to judge my project impossible were legion – and I must admit for the most part reasonable.  Still, I thought – I Knew – that the project could be done.  When opening day came around, the luxury hotel was everything I had wanted it to be, and its instant success surpassed even my own expectations.  Here was another impossible project that became 100 percent possible right from the start.  There are and will be many others – small and large – before and after.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A man’s opinions are less valuable than the information he gathers.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I still believe that my first successes were due to pure luck.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Luck, knowledge and hard work – especially hard work – are all necessary for a man to become a millionaire.  But, above all that, he needs what can be called the ‘millionaire mentality’: that essential state of mind and conscience which mobilizes the intelligence and all the talents of an individual to accomplish his tasks and realize the goals he has set for himself in business.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I never took pleasure in earning money.  Money is not necessarily related to happiness.  Maybe it is related to unhappiness.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Crises, reversals, obstacles – these are always encountered by all upper-management employees during their careers.  The value of a man under such circumstances is not dependent only on the way in which he confronts adversity, but also in his ability to turn adversity to his own advantage.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In my opinion, modern business has a great need for more entrepreneurs.  I believe there is more opportunity for a young man today than ever before, if only because specimens of the breed are fewer and farther between.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Whether you’re talking about general directors or specialists – such as buyers, production managers or sales managers – the key to all direction in business lies in directing human activities.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The individual who is able to perceive a glimmer of possibility in a situation that seems, at first glance, full of insurmountable obstacles, is the one who is most likely to reap the greatest benefits.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There are always occasions where businessmen can make a good profit if they could only recognize and seize the moment, and if they could ignore the negative sentiments expresses by those who become prophets of doom.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A man labelled a ‘billionaire’ lives well and he’s very lucky to enjoy innumerable privileges and comforts – but he really can’t win.  If he spends freely, he’s accused of being a wastrel and of trying to make an impression by splashing money around.  If he lives quietly and without flashy ostentation, he’s castigated for being penurious – a ‘tightwad’.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Praise should always be given in public, criticism should always be given in private.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My father said: ‘You must never try to make all the money that’s in a deal.  Let the other fellow make some money too, because if you have a reputation for always making all the money… you won’t make many deals.
