 ‘I chose to put my career first,’ she said, ‘and I cannot blame anyone for my happiness or lack thereof.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s not that bosses want you to give up your family or your hobbies.  They’re just driven by the desire to capture all of your energy and harness it for the company.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you want real work-life balance, find a company that accommodates it as part of its everyday business.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you don’t fulfill your own joy with your work-life plan, one day you’ll wake up in a special kind of hell, where everyone is happy but you.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>

Bring out the three old warhorses of competition – cost, quality, and service – and drive them to new levels, making every person in the organization see them for what they are, a matter of survival.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I just don’t like quotas in the boardroom or in the office.  Winning companies are meritocracies.  They practice differentiation, making a clear distinction between top, middle and bottom performers.  This system is candid and fair, and it’s the most effective way for an organization to field the best team.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>

Work-life moaners tend to be a phenomenon of below-average performers.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>

I don’t give a damn if we get a little bureaucracy as long as we get the results.  If it bothers you, yell at it.  Kick it.  Scream at it.  Break it!
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Pleasing the boss should never be more important than pleasing the customer.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t want to be part of a book.  I’m just a grungy, lousy manager.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Am I going to be the one who blows this place up?
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>

<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Without the right leaders developing and owning them, we’d get good-looking presentations and so-so results.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The mindset of yesterday’s manager – accepting compromise, keeping things tidy – bred complacency.  Tomorrow’s leaders must raise issues, debate them, and resolve them.  They must rally around a vision of what a business can become.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
We want to change the competitive landscape by being not just better than our competitors, but by taking quality to a whole new level.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I would have liked to have done things a lot faster.  I’ve been here [At GE] for 17 years.  Imagine if I’d taken 4, 3, or even 1 years too long in making my decisions.  I would have had a rude awakening.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As we became leaner, we found ourselves communicating better, with fewer interpreters and fewer filters.  We found that with fewer layers we had wider spans of management.  We weren’t managing better.  We were managing less, and that was better.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People always overestimate how complex business is.  This isn’t rocket science.  We’ve chosen one of the world’s simplest professions.

<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As I went to bigger pieces of GE, I found bigger bureaucracies, layers and all that stuff and it wasn’t friendly.  Business was very serious-turf-boxes.  Business isn’t that.  Business is ideas and fun and excitement and celebrations, all those things.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When you’re running an institution, you’re always scared at first.  You’re afraid you might break it.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If someone tells me ‘I’m working 90 hours a week,’ I say, ‘You’re doing something terribly wrong.’  I go skiing on the weekend, I go out with my buddies on Friday and party.  You’ve got to do the same or you’ve got a bad deal.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
