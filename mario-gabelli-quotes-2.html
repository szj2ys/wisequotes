When I started this firm in 1977, you couldn’t figure out what a company’s tax rate was or what its real earnings were because inflation had accelerated and made depreciation numbers hard to analyze.  So I said, ‘Look, it’s very simple: If you were an informed industrialist or a very wealthy person, what would you pay for the entire company?  And what will that company be worth in five, ten or 15 years?

There are very few people around who do bottom-up research and know their companies.  Plenty of people run their computers and devise income models for companies, but that’s not our culture…
<BR><a href="mario-gabelli-quotes.html">Mario Gabelli<a/>

What we try to do is to take advantage of opportunities by looking at companies that we like that are event driven, and generate an absolute return.

[On 1929 madness] During the madness of the 1929 and its aftermath, investors ‘watched the tape’ religiously.  Common wisdom was that if a stock declined it should be sold, quickly.
