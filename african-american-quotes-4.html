<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Education without social action is a one-sided value because it has no true power potential. Social action without education is a weak expression of pure energy. Deeds uninformed by educated thought can take false directions. When we go into action and confront our adversaries, we must be as armed with knowledge as they. Our policies should have the strength of deep analysis beneath them to be able to challenge the clever sophistries of our opponents. 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class, and our nation; and this means we must develop a world perspective. No individual can live alone, no nation can live alone, and as long as we try, the more we are going to have war in this world. 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Violence, even in self-defense, creates more problems than it solves. Only a refusal to hate or kill can put an end to the chain of violence in the world and lead us toward a community where men can live together without fear. Our goal is to create a beloved community and this will require a qualitative change in our souls as well as a quantitative change in our lives.

To attempt radical reform without adequate organization is like trying to sail a boat without a rudder. Recognizing that no army can mobilize and demobilize and remain a fighting unit, we will have to build far-flung, workmanlike and experienced organizations in the future if the legislation we create and the agreements we forge are to be ably and zealously superintended. 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
There can be unity when there isn’t uniformity. 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
But the danger point is that we will become so involved in the profit-making and profit-getting aspects . . . that we will forget certain ends of life. There is always the danger that we will become more concerned about making a living than making a life - that we will not keep that line of division between life and one’s livelihood. 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
And I’m simply saying this morning, that you should resolve that you will never become so secure in your thinking or your living that you forget the least of these. . . In some sense, all of us are the least of these, but there are some who are least than the least of these. I try to get it over to my children early, morning after morning, when I get a chance. As we sit at the table, as we did this morning in morning devotions, I couldn’t pray my prayer without saying, God, help us, as we sit at this table to realize that there are those who are less fortunate than we are. And grant that we will never forget them, no matter where we are. And I said to my little children, I’m going to work and do everything that I can do to see that you get a good education. I don’t ever want you to forget that there are millions of God’s children who will not and cannot get a good education, and I don’t want you feeling that you are better than they are. For you will never be what you ought to be until they are what they ought to be.

<BR> 
Across the miles they joined hands, and took a firm, forward step. It was a step that rocked the richest, most powerful nation to its foundations.

<BR>
<BR> 
We shall overcome. 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Prayer is a marvelous and necessary supplement to our feeble efforts, but it is a dangerous substitute. 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
If it falls your lot to be a street sweeper, sweep streets as Raphael painted pictures, sweep streets as Michelangelo carved marble, sweep streets as Beethoven composed music, sweep streets as Shakespeare wrote poetry. Sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will have to pause and say, ‘Here lived a great street sweeper who swept his job well.’ 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>

<BR>
Age is a question of mind over matter. If you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter. 
<BR><a href="satchel-paige-quotes.html">Satchel Paige<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
How old would you be if you didn’t know how old you was? 
How old would you be if you didn’t know how old you were? 
<BR><a href="satchel-paige-quotes.html">Satchel Paige<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I ain’t never had a job. I just always played baseball. 
<BR><a href="satchel-paige-quotes.html">Satchel Paige<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Don’t look back. Something might be gaining on you. 
<BR><a href="satchel-paige-quotes.html">Satchel Paige<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Don’t pray when it rains if you don’t pray when the sun shines. 
<BR><a href="satchel-paige-quotes.html">Satchel Paige<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
They want me to be old so I give ‘em what they want. Seems they get a bigger kick out of an old man throwing strikeouts. 
<BR><a href="satchel-paige-quotes.html">Satchel Paige<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Avoid fried meats, which angry up the blood. If your stomach disputes you, lie down and pacify it with cool thoughts. Keep the juices flowing by jangling around gently as you move. Go very light on the vices, such as carrying on in society – the social ramble ain’t restful. 
<BR><a href="satchel-paige-quotes.html">Satchel Paige<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
There ain’t no man can avoid being born average, but there ain’t no man got to be common.
