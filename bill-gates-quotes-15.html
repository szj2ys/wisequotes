It was July 5, 1991.  I’d taken part of Thursday off because that was July 4 and I was going to work on Friday.  There was important work to get done.  But I ceded to my mom’s strong request.  And then I met Warren [Buffett], and he and I just started talking.  And he asked me questions I had always wanted somebody to ask which showed a lot of understanding - OK, why didn’t IBM do this?  And why didn’t other computer companies do that?  And, you know, it just started a conversation that continues to this day about the fascinating world of business.

<BR>
I’m maniacal about malaria, aids, T.B.  I will talk longer than you could withstand about those things, because they’re all exciting things going on with those things, and education as well.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On releasing some mosquitoes at a TED conference] I thought this will liven them up… In every speech since then I’ve had to decide 
what I’m going to release.  Flies or...

<BR>
<BR>
[On his father’s relationship with his father’s sister] He felt sort of guilty that she didn’t get the same opportunities that he did.

<BR>
<BR>
[On working at his foundation] I didn’t know if it was it would provide the kind of depth and activity that I had gotten used to at Microsoft, which was a dream job.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[As a child] I could always get as many books as I wanted, I could go to the library.  I had a grandmother who would read to us.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Early reading let you imagine all these situations and start to think to yourself.  Could I ever run a business?  Could I ever discover something in science?
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I do think some positive reinforcement of - hey, you, you’re 
clever, you can do these things - at a young age takes you a long way.  
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] I envy my kids growing up right now.  When my son asks a question, sometimes I don’t know the answer.  And we’re over there at the computer watching the video of…
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On one of his children asking a question Bill doesn’t know the answer to but instead finding it together on the internet] If he gets an answer, that maybe means he’s more willing to ask the question the next time.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
How does an oil refinery work?  What are they doing?  And so you watch.  You see what goes in, you see what goes out…
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think a lot of people think there isn’t going to be an answer and they let their curiosity run down.  And I - with parents, with good teachers, I never got the sense that…
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] If we can put in reforms that make the next crisis 70 years from now, I’d say that that is fantastic.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] The last 70 years were unbelievable, and you’ve got to hope you don’t curve the kind of dynamism, innovation, incentive that led to such great results.  
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009 on equality in society compared to 50 years prior.] This society - although it’s very unjust - is far more just than what we can look back to.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On why Warren Buffett is the closest thing he has to a role model] Because of the integrity and thoughtfulness and joy he brings to everything he does… I’m continuing to learn from my dad, I’m continuing to learn from Warren, and many times when I’m making decisions, I try and model how they approach a problem.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If everybody was healthy and wealthy, that’s good.  It’s mankind.  If China invents a cure for cancer and you get cancer, you say ‘Thank you!  This is good.  We want it.’ 
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
More brains thinking about better products, better inventions.  And that raises the pace of the kind of innovation…

My dad is somebody I aspire to live up to what he’s done.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A love of reading.  A desire to ask questions…

<BR>
[His father, two sisters and mother were waiting to get into the car to go somewhere.  Then his mother said ‘Bill, what are you doing?’  He said] I’m thinking Mother.  Don’t you ever think?  [His mother and father looked at each other rather carefully and said ‘You know, I’m not sure we do.’]

<BR>
[On a psychiatrist/counselor he saw as a youngster] He said that I had this unfair advantage…
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the eradication of malaria being 10 years off in 2009] That would be optimistic.  Somewhere in the 10 or 20 year time frame, I think it can be done. 
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] My mom had high hopes that since we had been lucky enough to have these resources, that we’d give them back in the most impactful way…
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] I’m not golfing so much anymore.  
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On merit pay for teaching] Merit pay is a tough issue…
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s also easy to overestimate…
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009 in relation to income level and other needs] Having Internet in your home is not the most important thing in the poorest countries… It would be a misuse of resources to try to get home access into some area where you don’t have electricity, you don’t have basic medicines, over 20 percent of the children under five are dying of diseases that shouldn’t be plaguing us.  And so we have to put it in perspective.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When you get the culture right, when you get the teacher training and inclusion system right, that something magical can happen.  
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Polio in February 2011] If we don’t intensify, if we don’t really execute well in these next several years, it will spread back.  People won’t want to spend money on it, and we’ll be back to having 100,000 or more cases of kids dying or being paralyzed.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On how you eradicate polio] The polio fight started with the invention by Jonas Salk of this polio shot.  That was the first polio vaccine.  And then Sabin came along with the drops.  So those are our too two tools, the vaccines.  
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On eradicating a disease] It means zero, none, gone.  And that’s only happened with one human disease, which is smallpox.  All the way back in 1979 they certified that a disease that had killed over two million a year was now completely gone.  
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2011] If you improve health you do three things for children.  You save the lives, and that’s big.  The second is there’s lots of the kids who survive who are damaged, their brain never develops… And finally the one that’s the most amazing is you improve health, parents choose to have less kids.  So instead of better health growing the population, it’s actually the only thing we’ve ever come up with that actually shrinks population growth.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Many of these African countries are going to more than double their population unless we get on top of these health situations.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In 2003 it was actually a politician under the guise of making religious statements who spread bad rumors about the polio vaccine, that it sterilized women, it was plot, and for a while vaccination rates went way down.  
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You have to have the right tools.  Eradicating a disease is hard… We are spending hundreds of millions a year on the tools.  
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t want to overload people with my optimism, but once we get polio done then I think we can sit down and really see that we have the tools to take on both reducing disease burden for a lot of cases and take on one or two of the eradications… You’ve got to get polio done first.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We’ve certainly realized that delivery is harder than we expected and we have a lot of money in delivery, educating mothers about best practices and we’re trying to learn about that.
