Here is a breakfast food. I am very sorry that you cannot taste this, so I will taste it for you. [Laughter] Now this is a combination and, by the way, one of the finest breakfast foods that you or anyone else has ever seen. It is a combination of the sweet potato and the peanut, and if you will pardon a little digression here.

That is, it is a face cream and will be attractive to the ladies … 
<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
If we think of how the peanut is used, it is the only thing that is universally used among civilized and uncivilized people, and all sorts of animals like it, and I do not know of a single case — that is, I mean normal — that complains because peanuts hurt them. 
<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/>
