But this uncritical attitude could not last long, for it was contrary to the very nature of my being.  I had always been the been the precocious type.

Since [J. Pious] Barbour told the members of his church that my family was rich, the girls are running me down.  Of course, I don’t ever think about them, I am too busy studying.
