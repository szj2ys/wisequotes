[In June 2011.] We have a limited workforce… It will accelerate structural change and it will force government and business leaders to think about ‘What kind of jobs can we actually afford to have in this country?’  It’s been going on for twenty years.

<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2011 on human’s with regard to disliking a change of a job, a suburb or the like.] We’re stubborn.

[In August 2011 on Australia’s domestic conditions.] To the pessimist’s who say that unemployment will rise here sharply, I don’t agree.  You’ve got to look at the demographics and in Australia we’ve got a record number of people now moving towards retirement so the participation rates are pretty low.

<BR><a href="andrew-banks-quotes.html">Andrew Banks<a/>
<BR>
