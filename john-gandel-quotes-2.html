<BR><a href="john-gandel-quotes.html">John Gandel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why is there an urgency to get the budget into surplus – the government could easily take another two to three years to get the budget into surplus.  Also, the expenditure on the National Broadband Network could have waited and be introduced at a slower pace.  We may well suffer from the introduction of the carbon tax, NBN and a surplus budget.

[In 2012 on auctioning for charity to raise funds for the Royal Women’s Hospital, an exclusive lunch for five people with him in his boardroom] I have no idea how much I’m worth, but I will be disappointed if there’s only one bid of $10.  I also hope I won’t be sitting down to lunch with five tenants who will use the occasion to complain about business.

My parents always donated money for various philanthropic causes.  It is part of the Gandel psyche.  As our fortunes advanced, we have given substantial amounts of money to charity.  It is part of returning something back to the community, back to society so that other people can benefit more from families who have done well.

[In 2010 on donating $1 million to Victorian bushfire victims] When we heard about the bushfires we looked at each other and knew we had to do something immediate and substantial.

<BR><a href="john-gandel-quotes.html">John Gandel<a/>

We wanted our money to go where it was needed and we left it to the experts to determine where that should be.

Pauline was in America when I watched as our house burnt down. She came home the next day and it was devastating. It was very emotional. The year following was agony as we tried to salvage what we could. We paid large dry-cleaning bills to try and save some clothes but they were all ruined and smelt of fire. It was a bad time overall. 
We relate to the pain and loss of the victims of Black Saturday. In our case the fire brigade were marvellous and put anything they could under a tarpaulin to protect it from fire and water. We’d never experienced fire before. I couldn’t believe how quickly it destroys. We know how extraordinary the CFA were in doing what they could in the bushfires.

We’ve been successful, but I always say you need timing and good luck to stay stable and increase your net worth. We’ve been very fortunate and we want to give back. We’ve always made giving a priority and we are increasing our allocations where possible.

I am actually chairman of an Israeli organisation that’s given away 30,000 computers. It’s a $50 million dollar project.

The lifetime productivity of a child that gets a computer at age 5 is much greater than one who starts to use a computer at a later age.

[In 2010] I’m optimistic that the government’s stimulus packages will help our community. I don’t think there’s much choice. I don’t think anybody knows how long the journey to recovery will be.
