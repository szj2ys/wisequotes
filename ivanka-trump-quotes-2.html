I’ve kept a running count of all the countries I’ve visited, and as of this writing [In 2009] I’m past one hundred.  Most people I know can’t even name a hundred different countries, let alone claim any firsthand experience of them…

My grandfather [Fred Trump] had a lot of ideas on how to instill positive values and a strong work ethic in his children.  He also put a great many of them into play with me and my brothers.  When I was little, he used to flash a bright, shiny silver dollar and ask, ‘Would you like this Ivanka?’  I never knew where he got all those shiny new coins, but he always seemed to have a ready supply.  And of course I’d nod or smile or jump up and down.  ‘Well,’ he’d say, ‘before I can give it to you, you need to ask your grandmother if she has any chores for you to do.’  Then I’d find my grandmother and see if she needed any help, at which point she’d usually ask me to set the table or sweep the floor or help her mash the potatoes for dinner.  When I was through, I’d go back to my grandfather and report on my efforts.  ‘Very good,’ he’d say, handling over the silver dollar.  ‘This is for all your hard work.  You’ve earned it.’

Sure, my parents cast a big shadow.  Sure, their accomplishments can seem intimidating.  But I never shrank from the standards they set.  Instead, I’ve pushed myself even harder to fill all the spaces where their big shadows might not yet reach, to harness some of their power and influence and use it to propel myself forward in life.

It was never a question that I would work for a living.  It was hardly even a question what I would do.  The only questions in my mind, really, were how soon I could start, how high I might rise, and what I could do to fill my time productively until then.

My father used to say there was no such thing as being early to a business meeting.  You could be on time or you could be late, and that was it.
<BR><a href="ivanka-trump-quotes.html">Ivanka Trump<a/>
