That’s where we did the banner prank that sealed our friendship.   <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On a custom made TV signalling device] Woz would have it in his pocket and we’d go into a dorm… where a bunch of folks would be, like watching Star Trek, and he’d screw up the TV, and someone would go up to fix it, and just as they had the foot off the ground he would turn it back on, and as they put their foot back on the ground he’d screw it up again.  And within five minutes he would have someone like this.  [Like a human pretzel.]<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Woz picked me up a few minutes late, and we went to the library at SLAC [the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center] to see if we could find it.  I remember we were furiously digging through the stacks, and it was Woz who finally found the journal with all the frequencies.  It was like, holy sh*t, and we opened it and there it was.  We kept saying to ourselves, ‘It’s real.  Holy sh*t, it’s real.’  It was all laid out – the tones, the frequencies.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On ringing the pope at 5:30am] They realized that Woz wasn’t Henry Kissinger.  We were at a public phone booth.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I got together the rest of the components, like the casing and power supply and keypads, and figured out how we could price it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We made a hundred or so Blue Boxes and sold almost all of them.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>So we walk over to the car, Woz and me, and I’ve got the Blue Box in my hand, and the guy gets in, reaches under the seat, and he pulls out a gun.  So he’s pointing the gun right at my stomach, and he says, ‘Hand it over, brother.’  My mind raced.  There was the car door here, and I thought maybe I could slam it on his legs and we could run, but there was this high probability that he would shoot me.  So I slowly handed it to him, very carefully.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>If it hadn’t been for the Blue Boxes, there wouldn’t have been an Apple.  I’m 100% sure of that.  Woz and I learned how to work together, and we gained the confidence that we could solve technical problems and actually put something into production.  You cannot believe how much confidence that gave us.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Chrisann Brennan] We worked together on an animated movie, then started going out, and she became my first real girlfriend.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It was great.  I had been listening to a lot of Bach.  All of a sudden the wheat field was playing Bach.  It was the most wonderful feeling of my life up to that point.  I felt like the conductor of this symphony with Bach coming through the wheat.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>I’m going to live in a cabin with Chrisann.  ‘No you’re not.  Over my dead body’ he [My father] said.   <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On working for $3 hours in heavy full-body Alice in Wonderland costumes] It was hot, the costumes were heavy, and after a while I felt like I wanted to smack some of the kids.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I think I might have headed to New York if I didn’t go to college.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The kids who went to Stanford, they already knew what they wanted to do.  They weren’t really artistic.  I wanted something that was more artistic and interesting.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On refusing to let his parents come onto campus] It’s one of the things in life I really feel ashamed about.  I was not very sensitive, and I hurt their feelings.  I shouldn’t have.  They had done so much to make sure I could go there, but I just didn’t want them around.  I didn’t want anyone to know I had parents.  I wanted to be like an orphan who had bummed around the country on trains and just arrived out of nowhere, with no roots, no connections, no background.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On book ‘Be Here Now’ –Baba Ram Das] It was profound.  It transformed me and many of my friends.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>There was a hatch in the ceiling leading to an attic which had a huge amount of space.  We took psychedelic drugs there sometimes, but mainly we just meditated.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I began to realize that an intuitive understanding and consciousness was more significant than abstract thinking and intellectual logical analysis.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I got into it in my typical nutso way.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On purer fasts] After a week you start to feel fantastic.  You get a ton of vitality from not having to digest all this food.  I was in great shape.  I felt I could get up and walk to San Francisco anytime I wanted.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>I thought.  This is kind of far out.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On communal economics] It started to get very materialistic.  Everybody got the idea they were working very hard for Robert’s [Friedland] farm, and one by one they started to leave.  I got pretty sick of it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Robert [Friedland] always portrayed himself as a spiritual person, but he crossed the line from being charismatic to being a con man.  It was a strange thing to have one of the spiritual people in your young life turn out to be, symbolically and in reality, a gold miner.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>They are making me take all these courses.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>All of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition.  I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.  And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.  So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.  I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great.  It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.  And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I came of age at a magical time.  Our consciousness was raised by Zen, and also by LSD.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Taking LSD was a profound experience, one of the most important things in my life.  LSD shows you that there’s another side to the coin, and you can’t remember it when it wears off, but you know it.  It reinforced my sense of what was important – creating things instead of making money, putting things back into the stream of history and of human consciousness as much as I could.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The only reason I shone was that everyone else was so bad.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Ron [Wayne] was an amazing guy.  He started companies.  I had never met anybody like that.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Yeah, I think I know what it is.  I think you [Ron Wayne] like men.    <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>When you see a beautiful woman, what do you feel?  Ron [Wayne] replied, ‘It’s like when you look at a beautiful horse.  You can appreciate it, but you don’t want to sleep with it.  You appreciate beauty for what it is.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>For me it was a serious search.  I’d been turned on to the idea of enlightenment and trying to figure out who I was and how I fit into things.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’m going to find my guru.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I had a wonderful couple of weeks in Turin, which is this charged-up industrial town.  The distributor took me every night to dinner at this place where there were only eight tables and no menu.  You’d just tell them what you wanted, and they made it.  One of the tables was on reserve for the chairman of Fiat.  It was really super.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[Taxi driver in New Delhi when original hotel was full] I’m sure he was getting some baksheesh, because he took me to this complete dive.  I got dysentery pretty fast.  I was sick, really sick, a really high fever.  I dropped from 160 pounds to 120 in about a week. <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>There were holy men all around.  Tents with this teacher and that teacher.  There were people riding elephants, you name it.  I was there for a few days, but I decided that I needed to get out of there too.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>There was a copy there of Autobiography of a Yogi in English that a previous traveller had left, and I read it several times because there was not a lot to do, and I walked around from village to village and recovered from my dysentery.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It was a chance to meet a spiritual being and hang out with his followers, but it was also a chance to have a good meal.  I could smell the food as we got near, and I was very hungry.  He said, ‘You are just like a baby’.  I was not relishing this attention.  We sit down and he pulls out this straight razor.  I’m thinking he’s a nutcase and begin to worry.  Then he pulls out a bar of soap – I had long hair at the time – and he lathered up my hair and shaved my head.  He told me that he was saving my health.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-16.html">16<a/> </p><p><BR>
