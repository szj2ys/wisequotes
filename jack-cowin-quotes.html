[On doing a KFC feasibility study in 1968] On our first night in Sydney, we had a few beers and decided to eat at a Chinese restaurant.  There were about 50 people waiting impatiently for their food, so you didn’t have to be Einstein to figure out there was a market for fast food.

[On Australia] It’s an independent country where people can grow and develop a business.  There’s a positive attitude here that pervades society.  The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well, as opposed to North America, where big companies dominate everything and huge corporations run corner stores.  Canada, in some ways, is a suburb of the US with regard to business culture.

<BR><a href="jack-cowin-quotes.html">Jack Cowin<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
KFC told me to ‘use it or lose it’.  I had to get started in Perth and I needed $300,000 to do it.
