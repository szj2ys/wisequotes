[In October 2004 on Fox apparel.] Fox has deep roots in action sports and is highly respected by the fashion-conscious youth-lifestyle market.  Fox is the most recognized and best-selling brand of motorcross apparel in the world.  Our new collaborative partnership will allow us to combine our experience and design capabilities to develop sunglasses and goggles bearing the Fox logo for this key target demographic.

[In July 2007 on the Luxottica Group acquiring Oakley.  (And him selling all his shares at that time at a price of $29.30/share.)] Mr Del Vecchio and I start in the industry at about he same time and took our companies on different paths.  We were both relentless in our desire to create great products and build unique organizations and I have always had tremendous respect for Mr Del Vecchio as a partner and a competitor.  I am very excited that we have found a way to join forces.  Oakley’s technology and performance is one of the world’s best kept secrets and this partnership should empower our ability to tell our story throughout the world.  I am encouraged by the fact that Luxottica’s management has come to understand the unique, rogue nature of Oakley in the eyewear industry and is committed to preserving it.  Oakley will continue to be Oakley but with much greater resources and a platform for realizing the true potential of our brand and company.  Given the opportunities in front of us, I wrote Mr Del Vecchio this morning indicating my intent to make an investment in the company after the transaction closes.

<BR>
Ideas lead to inventions which sometime[s] lead to patents…  But the market is the final judge [of] how good the idea actually is.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We are primarily an invention, technology and engineering company that happens to be best known for our sunglasses.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006 on shooting film/cameras.] I have been shooting for 30 years.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] I have always wanted to build a camera and this is the right time because there is a great big window of opportunity right now.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is a big hole between the 1/3’ HDV cameras and the professional market. We see this as the prime opportunity to really give a true alternative to film.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Year after year we win the ‘Optics Shootouts’ by a wide margin in published independent tests.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We have the clearest optical material (Plutonite) in the industry which results in less haze and measurably better clarity.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] All Oakley lenses have the highest impact rating in the industry. You can shoot them all with a 12 gauge shotgun at 5 yards. They won't crack, break or come out of the frame. A little known fact is that the military re-wrote their specs when they saw the optical and impact comparison tests our our glasses vs. the ‘others’.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] We invent, design, engineer, prototype and build all our products from data. Nothing hand made. No one else in our industry does this. And we started the drive for technical prowess over 20 years ago.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] We don't see a camera or lenses as a ‘big leap’.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] The RED camera is NOT being done at Oakley, but the program has the backing of Oakley resources. The lenses will be done by Oakley.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006 on his RED camera.] I have always said that we build our sunglasses so that if we don't sell one pair, I will be happy wearing it. The same philosophy is in play here.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] We understand the market's wishes for the final product capability AND pricing. For versatility and flexibility.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] We cannot come up with another camera that offers a slight advantage to current market offerings and expect to be successful. We need to ‘skip several generations of evolution’. That's our plan.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] I've taken a lot of ribbing for some of the names I have come up with for our materials and products over the years.  Unobtainium was the 1st back in 1976. ‘Thermonuclear Protection’ was another. The ‘Mysterium’ sensor is just that.   
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] The flexibility of our camera will be shocking.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006 on RED Camera] I'm going to be really depressed if we only sell 1000 cameras.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006 on the RED Camera] We are building as open a system as possible.

<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] The RED camera will work for many shooters, from the wedding videographer, Indie filmmaker, industrial shooter, and professional cinematographer.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] This won't be a plastic camera. It will look and feel more like a film camera than a traditional video camera.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006 on his first RED Camera website] I built the site and did what I wanted. I have no website building experience so it is, admittedly, remedial… I’m not in a hurry.  BTW, I have taken a lot of crap for the site.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his digital camera that has the look and feel of 35mm.] There’s talent on the streets, kids with ideas who have stories to tell and never have a chance.  Up to now, they’ve been limited to tools that confine their stories to You Tube.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
 [In February 2008] Keep in mind that we believe in the dates and timeframes we quote.  If we are late, it is not because we tried to trick you… it is because we are revolutionizing an industry and we have never been here before… This declaration should cover hardware, software, and every other thing we are doing.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Red Scarlet compared with Red One] All different now.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In Jun 2010 on delays to deliveries.] Trust me when I tell you that we have been humbled.  I have questioned our aggressive goals every day.  Epic and Scarlet are complicated cameras.  Probably the most complicated cameras ever attempted.  We have a crack team on it.  The amount of development for this program is unprecedented.  But somewhere in the complication… we have a bug.  It has help us up now for two months.  We have working cameras, as you know.  But we aren’t going to release anything until the cameras are done and bug free.  And we have stumbled on an issue that has caused us considerable grief.  It is unexpected, and it has us baffled.  The fix could be tomorrow… or not.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2010] The RED ONE is now one of the most reliable cameras in the industry (after a humble beginning).  EPIC will not be a step backward.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In Jan 2011 the EPIC-S camera is focused on] Pro, not prosumer.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Let’s just do things that go against the grain of mediocrity.
<BR><a href="james-jannard-quotes.html">James Jannard<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bonus 
<BR>
<BR>
[On Oakley’s three purposes] First, to made wicked cool products, Second, to have fun.  And third to make enough money to do the first two.
