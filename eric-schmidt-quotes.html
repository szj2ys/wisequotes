Groups are stronger, groups are faster. None of us is as smart as all of us.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> To figure this out, you need to actually turn off your computer.  <BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> I promise I’m not a croaky-voiced dalek.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Nobody really gives a sh*t about search.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Futurist Alvin Toffler once said, ‘Change is not merely necessary to life – it is life.’  He believed that the great engine of change is technology, which builds on itself and thus makes the next advanced technologies possible.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>Gutenberg’s printing press, Edison’s lightbulb, and Bell’s telephone are all examples of early technological innovations that dramatically transformed the ways in which people lived, learned, and communicated.  Truly disruptive technologies such as these actually change the social norms as richer and more pervasive models emerge.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> As Henry Ford said, ‘If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.’  Ford’s ability to upend the status quo and create a new category is a good example of what fuels the continuous engine of change.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Technological change is certainly now new.  What is new is the exponential increase in the rate of technological advancements, and the result is our growing interconnectedness as a global society.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> History has demonstrated the direct correlation between the amount of information available to an average citizen and the economic progress in that citizen’s country.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Each day, more and more people around the world gain access to new information and additional tools to help them collaborate, communicate, formulate ideas, and dive instantaneously into the live stream of knowledge.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> There are roughly 3 billion Google searches conducted each day; Facebook’s 500 million users post about 700 status updates per second; Twitter’s 190 million users tweet 65 million times a day; and since it was introduced in 2003, 250 billion minutes of free Skype-to-Skype calls have been made.  These are today’s figures; by the time you read this, all of them will have grown.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Skype are similar in that they are rapidly transforming our world.  But they also share another common element; all four of these companies are venture backed.  If the venture capital industry did not exist, it’s possible, even likely, that none of these businesses would be around today.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Venture capital is much more than money.  It’s the passion and intelligence that links an enthusiastic entrepreneur’s groundbreaking vision with the successful execution of that vision.  It is what can transform a dorm-room startup into a global powerhouse.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> [On his biography being projected onto a wall] I thought that was really odd.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> [On his first meeting with Sergey and Larry, talking about the stupidity of the strategy he was executing at Novell] I argued back hard.  We argued for at least 90 minutes.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>[On being asked by the Google guys what he would like to do]  I am busy selling a company.  I am happy to be chairman of Google and be CEO at some point in the future.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> I agree that as the company grows my experience would be helpful.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> John's role was fundamental.  When you looked at Google from the outside, it looked like Larry and Sergey having a lot of fun with smart people. Mike [Moritz] and John brought gravitas to the effort. That should not be trivialized.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> You can't be CEO and not show up.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Not only was I CEO and chairman, but I was also an investor of real money, the company literally needed the cash. And they wanted to see a real commitment.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> The place was always a zoo.  That was fine for a start-up, but not for this company with 200 employees and $20 million in revenue<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> That was a huge fight.  They couldn't imagine why it made sense to pay all that money to Oracle when Quicken was available.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> The underlying structure and strategy and culture were good.  The most apt description of what I did in the first year or two was put a business and management structure around the vision and gem that Larry and Sergey had created.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> When I got here the company had credit cards that didn't get billed to individuals. Larry and Sergey just gave credit cards out. The first thing I did was cancel all the credit cards except one, which Larry and Sergey controlled. They gave their card to other people to use to buy stuff, just to spite me. One day a telephone booth showed up in my office. I said, 'Who bought the telephone booth?' We tracked it down to somebody who had their credit card number. It was very entertaining. One day these massage chairs showed up. Who bought 'em? I don't know. A little bit of mischief goes a long way.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> [On doing a deal with AOL with a multimillion dollar guarantee] I was terrified.  Larry and Sergey and I argued hard. I understood that if you ran out of cash, you were done. They were more willing to take risk than me. They turned out to be right.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>[On Overture stock losing nearly one-third of its value on the news that it had lost the AOL business to Google.] This is an important endorsement of our advertising model and the way our customers view us.  Our business outlook is very good and this AOL deal will help us.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> [On doing a deal with Ask Jeeves] This agreement will put our advertisers in front of millions of new users while also offering them new audience characteristics distinct to Ask Jeeves.  Google and Ask Jeeves have a shared vision of making it easy and efficient for people to search on the Web. By working in partnership, we will help grow the overall search market.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> [On the StoryRank product] This is a cool product.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> [On SEC] These things happen.  We've seen worse.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Charlie [Ayers] created the culture here for us.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Evil is whatever Sergey says is evil.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> You are playing on a much bigger stage with much bigger stakes.  <BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> We compete with Yahoo every day.  Microsoft has announced their entry into the market, though they are not a significant competitor yet, although I am sure they will try.  Microsoft has publicly announced that they are going to imbed search in every single bit there is on a PC screen. So that is going to be their entry, but that will be some months, or years, depending on what schedule you assume.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Our users are everywhere.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> We try to keep it small. You just don't get productivity out of large groups.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="eric-schmidt-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="eric-schmidt-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="eric-schmidt-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="eric-schmidt-quotes-5.html">5<a/> </p><p><BR>
