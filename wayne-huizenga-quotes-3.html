<BR>
I’d just gotten back from the Army and my father said I’ll take you for lunch tomorrow.  
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The last thing I wanted to do was be in the garbage collection business…
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On buying an early garbage collection business from Wilbur Porter] I said Wilbur, I want to buy the business but I don’t have any money.  And finally Wilbur says ‘Okay,  I’ll sell you the business and finance you.’  That was my first leveraged buyout.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his garbage collection business] We happened to be there at the right time… And in 1971 we took the company public.  
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his management style] I work through people… I don’t try to do everything myself.  I try to delegate.  I have the best people possible… They in turn have to hire the best people to run the businesses.  The most important thing is people.  
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you have five good people working for you and they’re each working on five deals, then that’s a lot of stuff happening.          
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] First of all I’d like to just get out of a depression stage and get back into a recession again, that would be nice.  I think we are and we’re gradually starting to come out of it.  We need to get back to a recession first and nothing really is going to happen until we can get some financing.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The NFL is a business like any other business…
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2010] Sure, everyone’s concerned about inflation… We worried about inflation and we’re worried about deflation.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m going to miss Blockbuster.  I’m gonna miss being CEO and all that stuff.  We had an atmosphere where everybody was happy.  When people make money, they’re happy.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On what’s more important: the ideas or the execution] The execution, because there are many great ideas, but you must be able to execute to succeed.  It’s like being the quarterback on the team or the head coach.  You pick your players, develop the game plan and together, you must execute.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On what motivates him] Working with great people who make it happen, and seeing the results.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People are what determine your success in the future.  Surround yourself with good people and you won’t fail.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Our business team has been fortunate to be involved in more than one thousand deals, both buying and selling companies over the last forty years.  During one nine-month period while we were building Waste Management, we bought one hundred companies.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the book Masters of the Universe] The lessons from this book would have been a great tool in the early days of making deals.  The school of hard knocks is definitely overrated.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On doing deals] Always try to put yourself in the other person’s shoes.  It’s vital to try to understand in depth what the other side really wants out of the deal.  
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On deals] You have to try to understand in depth what the other side really wants out of the deal.  You have to treat the other person fairly and honestly, just as you would want to be treated.  It has to be a win-win situation for both sides.  
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[More on doing deals] The other players in the deal can’t feel they’ve lost.  This is especially critical if the two parties are going to continue to work together.  In today’s world of mega-deals you never know when you will find yourself sitting across the negotiating table from that person again.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Virtually every phase of life is filled with the process of negotiating.  People negotiate throughout their lives: marriage, buying a car, finding a bargain at a garage sale, agreeing on what movie to rent for the evening, finding the right company to round out a corporate vision.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Today at AutoNation USA, we are focused on selling and leasing new and used cars.  Thus far we have purchased more than four hundred new car dealerships, acquired National and Alamo car rental companies, and opened forty AutoNation USA superstores.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
The process of negotiation for buying a car is one that we believe one day will be drastically different… At our AutoNation USA superstores vehicles are sold under a one-price, no haggling method.  The price on the car is fixed and there is no negotiation.  And the age old method of involving a trade-in doesn’t have to be part of the process.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You should feel comfortable sending your children to buy a new or used automobile.  After all, automobile manufacturers have increased the quality of their product for more than fifty years; however, the sales method has remained quite antiquated.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Many times when we are attempting to acquire a company we are also looking for a new partner.  We want people to join our team, not just sell us a company.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We look at an industry and try to see where that industry could be in three, five, and ten years down the road.  We want sellers to share that vision and help us reach the future by offering their unique experience.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On getting involved with Blockbuster] We were in the right place at the right time but had to be persuaded to take a closer look.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You have to do what you think is the right thing because when you’re making a deal you have to live with the consequences and the many lives that are going to be affected.  There definitely is a greater good than simply the profit to be earned from the transaction.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My whole life has been a series of wonderful coincidences or being in the right place at the right time…
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We still have a passion for what we do.  It’s not making the investment for the sake of making the investment.  It still is having fun.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On how to decide whether to acquire a new business] The instinct comes first and the analysis comes later…
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Treat everybody the same and you know in life you will be remembered not as a person who has a lot of money but you will be remembered in life as a person who treated everybody with respect, and a genuine nice person.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
There I was with no money, and had to run the business.  That’s how it got started.  But it wasn’t because I had a vision.  It wasn’t because I wanted to be in the trucking business or the garbage business or anything like that.  It just was a coincidence…
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Some people can grow a business and some people can operate a business… I’m a better builder than an operator.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2011] I look at the lockout as no different to any other business.  The NFL is a business like any other business.    
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The fans want to see the game played.  The fans know that the players make a lot of money.  The fans think that the owners make a lot of money.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As long as you’re playing the game, that’s all anyone really cares about.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have no clue, but I don’t think it will be long and drawn out.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Miami Dolphins after he has departed as owner] I think they’ve done a great job.  I have no complaints.    
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Miami Heat in May 2011] I predict that they’ll go all the way…
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Surround yourself with good people and you won’t fail.
<BR><a href="wayne-huizenga-quotes.html">Wayne Huizenga<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Why do you climb the mountain?  Because it’s there.
