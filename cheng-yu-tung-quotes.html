Do you know of the water and the moon?  The river flows endlessly, yet it never disappears.  The moon waxes and wanes, yet it never grows bigger or smaller.  Therefore, if you look in the eyes of change, everything in this world changes in an instant.  But if you look in the eyes of stability, everything in the world, including humanity, is eternal.  Dozens of worlds have demonstrated precisely the truth of the changing universe.  The changes of the water and the moon happen on their appearances, but never on their physical natures.  Therefore, whether changes happen depends on people’s mind and view.  Since nothing remains permanent in the world, change is just the eternal fact.

<BR><a href="cheng-yu-tung-quotes.html">Cheng Yu Tung<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

Quoting from Chapter 2 of the Sayings Of Confucius, ‘At 30, I stood firm; at 40, I had no more doubts.’  Time has its role to play in one’s behaviour and how one conducts himself in society.  With the passage of time, we master our lives better and become more refined and polished, step by step.  At the age of 30, one can overcome difficulties.  By the age of 40, one has thorough appreciation of and insights into the world and becomes firmly self-assured without being carried away by all those irregularities in life.

<BR><a href="cheng-yu-tung-quotes.html">Cheng Yu Tung<a/>

The Chinese generally believe, ‘no man can place himself in society without integrity; no family will be blessed with harmony without mutual trust among its members; no trade can flourish without credit; and no nation can enjoy peace without public confidence.’

[In 2009] In 1973 when the Hong Kong stock market witnessed an unprecedented slump with the Hang Seng Index plunging by over 90% in a year, the Group built the New World Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong through the acquisition of Holt’s Wharf.  In doing so we broke the dominance of the UK-based conglomerates and, as if [being given] a shot in the arm, initiated the course of weaving the companies with Chinese capital into the economic fabric of Hong Kong.
<BR><a href="cheng-yu-tung-quotes.html">Cheng Yu Tung<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] In 1984, the Sino-British talks on the future of Hong Kong triggered a confidence crisis.  Daunted by the uncertainties over the colony’s future, most developers shied away from construction projects that took considerable time to complete.  In that year the Group recognized what the community needed and actively responded to the government’s call for a landmark convention and exhibition venue of international standard to be built in Hong Kong.  The Group turned out to be the only developer willing to take financial and operating risks on a long-term basis, thereby laying a solid foundation for Hong Kong to host international conventions and exhibitions.  Coupled with its excellent services, Hong Kong soon secured world-wide recognition as an ideal spot of conferences and exhibitions.
<BR><a href="cheng-yu-tung-quotes.html">Cheng Yu Tung<a/>

[In 2009] The arrival of the 21st century precedes the onslaught of turmoil and tsunami.  The business environment has become unpredictable and the global economy even harsher… 
<BR><a href="cheng-yu-tung-quotes.html">Cheng Yu Tung<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] Backed by our conviction, we remain committed to investing wholeheartedly to improve the people’s living conditions, regardless of all uncertainties.
<BR><a href="cheng-yu-tung-quotes.html">Cheng Yu Tung<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] We survive the market volatility and political changes.  We cater for the actual need of the people and keep pace with the country.
