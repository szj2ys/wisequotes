<BR>
[In 2002] We have the necessary room to start more stores.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Show me a creative - no matter what industry - which now sits in a dark basement and is not looking at what the competition is doing.   Everyone steals with their eyes.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010] Geographically, there are lots of opportunities.  For example, we aren’t present in South America, we aren’t present in Australia and we aren’t present in Africa.  We are still pretty small in most countries outside the Nordic region and perhaps Germany.  So there is still a lot to do in the countries we are already in.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2009] We’re convinced we’ll emerge stronger out of this downturn.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2001 on the H&M range being 95 percent the same wherever you go] You carry fewer adjustments because the markets are more or less the same everywhere.  We read more or less the same magazines, watch the same movies and listen to the same music.  That’s good for us.  We need less customisation.  It might be a bit boring that all countries are alike, but that’s good for a global company like H&M.  
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2001 on him entering the US market with] Respect, and humility.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On entering the US market appealing to younger, fashion-conscious females.] This is a good niche market and it is our niche. That was missing in the United States. I think the customers want something different, something fashion conscious, a greater variety and a wider range than our competitors. And the price is very attractive.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It always takes a lot of money to go to a new market. We have always said and I think we have informed about the market.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2001 on entering new markets.] You want everything absolutely in order and therefore give you more than when you're an established and running efficiently. But the [stock] market is currently so shortsighted and they sometimes do not understand that you have to sow before you can reap. They want an immediate return, ideally in the first quarter
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
An IPO has advantages, such as constantly being alert to controlling management.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ikea is very Swedish and promotes itself as a Swedish company. We do not. We are H&M - H&M Germany, H&M Belgium. Internationally, Sweden is not the centre of fashion.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the culture of H&M] It is the informality. Anyone can speak with anyone, there are no formal meetings. Common sense. The commercial sense. Instinctively what is right. Flexibility and speed. Cost awareness is also crucial if we are to survive with our idea of the best price-performance ratio. Each crown (dollar) that is spent unnecessarily, has ultimately affect the price and can threaten our entire concept.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We have the financial strength, but the question is whether our flexibility and our culture can be maintained each year taking in 2,000-4,000 people.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2001] I am the principal shareholder and therefore I will always have an active interest in the development of the company. Anything else would be hypocritical to say.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We have learned that you are not just a Scandinavian concept and that you cannot just simply take a Scandinavian concept to other countries and expect to successfully reap.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If we are to survive with our business idea of having the best price and value, every unnecessarily spent krona [Swedish currency] will ultimately be put on the price and threaten the whole business idea.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003 on hordes of shoppers queuing up for their first H&M store in Manhanttan] As a newcomer to the U.S., we were pleasantly surprised by the positive reaction.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On H&M opening 60 new stores in 1998 with eight opened in the last week alone in 1998.  This pace of opening can continue] For many years to come.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998 on H&M’s growth] May just be starting.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] The economic downturn is hurting sales but less so than for many of H&M’s competitors thanks to H&M’s low-price profile.  The downturn is also creating new opportunities for H&M to gain market share and find store space in attractive locations.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>

<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2000 on H&M’s stock price plunging 30%.  Investment pro’s without cause had] Took fright.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997] When we expand, it is important to listen carefully to the local market.  We need to adapt but not at the expense of losing what makes us who we are.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1996] we aim to offer the absolute latest fashions at the lowest price for comparable products.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The majority of European consumers – especially families with children – saw their purchasing power decline in 1996.  That is why we decided to reduce our prices, which made the difference between our prices and those of our competitors even greater.  Lowering our prices boosted sales by 28 percent in comparable currencies.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
H&M has always placed priority on good liquidity.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1996] We have expanded using our own funds, and we have always been able to consider our moves without having to take external factors, such as borrowing or managing our own real estate, into account.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1996] Our financial strength provides security for shareholders and employees.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The fact that we published several catalogues that did not rely heavily on seasonal sales also contributed greatly to our success.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Our goal is to provide better service and better quality without raising prices.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We do not manufacture ourselves nor do we own any factories, but the fact that we are a major buyer gives us considerable influence.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We do not intend to rest on our laurels...
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1996] Child labour is another issue that continues to attract attention.  Consequently, we would like to emphasize the fact that we never work with a company that uses child labour.  We will cancel any contract with a supplier that does.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1996] H&M’s success is based on a high degree of decentralised decision-making and very strong central management.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We have a flat organisation with very few levels between customers and management.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1996] H&M has a total of 15,000 employees.  Each year we employ more than 2,000 people, and it is important to spread the H&M spirit to them.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We always strive to recruit internally when new positions become available.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Focusing on costs is another important aspect of our corporate culture... Every krona that we spend affects our prices and our business concept.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1997, we will begin operating in Finland for the first time.  France will be next in line.  All in all, we plan to open more than 50 new stores.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1996] We have reached the limit for traditional expansion in Sweden and have begun to focus on developing and changing existing stores.
<BR><a href="stefan-persson-quotes.html">Stefan Persson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1996] Germany remains our largest market…
