<BR>
[In August 2011] I believe in our team.  I believe in Joe [Flacco].  I believe in our coaches.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2011] I would love to get some more Ravens fans across the pond.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2011] Baltimore fans, Ravens fans, I love you.  You’re the best. Everything I do is trying to bring you a winner. I appreciate your support. We’re not perfect here, but Lord knows we try.  Hopefully, we’ll be setting up a parade in the near future.  I certainly hope so.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Okay, so what is the worst thing you ever got away with?
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012] I’m not over it.  The more you get into 2012, the more you realize the pain is going away.  But, no, you’re not over it, but we have to move on.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012] When you work as hard as you do to put a team together like this… they become kind of like sons to you.  So you feel for them.  You can’t get mad.  This business is about managing your mistakes and managing your failures.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012] So inopportune things like that kill these guys and I die with them.  I don’t lash out.  It’s just different.  You end up caring for these guys.  You know how much time and effort they put in and it breaks your heart that someone’s got to be the goat.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012 on the Ravens record of the last four years being one of both pride and disappointment.] I am proud of it… I'm proud of the product we're giving to Baltimore. But, yeah, this is a business. I've told you in the past, if it wasn't for the elation you get from winning, no one would subject themselves to this kind of pain or suffering. You might think I lay on the beach all day with this tan, but I don't.  
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You come home from losses some nights and you think: 'What are you putting yourself through this?' And then you experience those wins and you remind yourself that with the good comes the bad. Yeah, a lot of pride and a lot of disappointment.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Joe Flacco] Should we get him a coach and tell him to fake it and be a ra-ra guy, and next thing you know, he's focused on something other than what we want him to focus on…
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Joe Flacco] I think that he will be rewarded for his personality in the long run. And hopefully our fans will too.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[June 2012 on the Baltimore Ravens partnership with Under Armour.] The basics.  The best company in Baltimore, the highest profile company in Baltimore, the most passionate company in Baltimore.  And a friendship that with Kevin [Plank] goes back ten years.  To try and create synergy with a brand like Under Armour it extends from the pride of our friendship and the pride of both of us being some pretty cool brands in Baltimore.  
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In many ways, Art [Arthur Modell – previous owner of the Baltimore Ravens] is the NFL.  I’d be short-sighted not to take advantage of his expertise.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Art Modell passing away.] He was my friend, my mentor.  We will miss him so much.  How lucky are all of us to have had Art in Baltimore?  How fortunate am I to have had him teach me about the NFL.  His generosity, his love, his humor, his intelligence, his friendship – we are all blessed by this great man.  We will strive to live up to his stan dard.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On a Ray Lewis statue.] I’ll say absolutely maybe.  We have to work that out where and how long it takes.  But yes, he sets himself apart in Baltimore sports history.  And we certainly look into and I would not be surprised if there’s one there in the next year of two.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you have 53 young rich guys, they’re going to make mistakes.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It doesn’t bother me.  I’m doing it a little bit myself as a fan.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2013 on the relationship between the Orioles and Baltimore Ravens] Never gotten along better.  That has everything to do with the Orioles winning because when the Orioles are winning, the fans stop saying bad things about the Orioles because they are getting their cake and getting it, too.  When the Orioles were struggling, we were going to get the majority of the positive press.  It’s got to be very difficult for the Orioles to put up with that for an extended period of time.  But as Baltimore sports fans, we love the Orioles being good and we hope they continue to be good.  I think if you have two teams that have the same fans and both teams are winning, Baltimore is in a great spot.  That’s what we’re all shooting for.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We always have fun.  We have fun when we lose [too].
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2013 on winning the Super Bowl again.] I think you can say, ‘We have a five percent chance of repeating. We have a 20 percent chance of winning one in the next five years, so it’s three or four times more. I kind of look at it like that.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
It’s silly to all of the sudden change all of your expectations.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We come up with pros and cons, and come down on one side of the ledger…
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Ozzie’s recipe is what Ozzie’s recipe is, and I can’t change the recipe. I can’t change one ingredient and not change the entire thing.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
And that’s kind of the fun of the business – picking your spots. I can’t change teams, they can.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Ray Rice, Joe Flacco, and Torrey Smith] These are great guys. Solid, solid citizens. And they have been waiting for this opportunity, and I think they seized it right before our eyes.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You have to scale the mountain to find the cliff. This is what happens when teams win. It’s a lot better than the year before, when you wondered if you’d ever get back again
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think when you have standout performers like we had in Ray Rice that you have an obligation to keep a number of those great performers.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We always had great leaders and high paid guys on offense.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2013] We know that we’d be making tough decisions. But hopefully our fans realize that is part of the business and it didn’t preclude us from reproducing with some big changes, a playoff-caliber team
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We lead the league in compensatory picks, and to me that is the clearest indication to me that we draft as well as anybody. Because if you lead the league in comp picks, and you spend to cap every year like we do, then the proof is that every guy we let go we let go because we financially can’t fit them under the cap.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2013] I think the market is changing. I think the top 10 guys on teams, if you looked at it, are making a higher and higher percentage of the overall cap then they were when I got into the league 12 years ago.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2013] I’m not in that camp that I think we’re changing the game that much.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2013] I think that these guys are a brotherhood and they can complain all they want, but I think that we’re proving to our fans and the players are starting to understand that it’s in their long-term best interest to protect these guys from those kinds of headshots. I’m 100 percent in favor of all the rules that we’ve passed.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I would be comfortable if I was the least known owner in pro-sports.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[January 2013] I believe I’m becoming more well known.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My no socks that everyone seems to want to pay attention to.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2013] I’m more recognizable every year.  And that’s fine.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2013] We need Joe [Flacco] to get 10% better every year.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On getting people to respect Joe Flacco.] It’s like been pulling teeth.
<BR><a href="steve-bisciotti-quotes.html">Steve Bisciotti<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think that my expectation for the team was can we absorb the loss of guys like… Nothing changes.
