[On starting in 1908 a giant Packard car when an electric self-starter was not available until 1912 and having been a 110-pound teenager unable to hand-crank the heavy Packard engine after several tries – He dipped a rag into the gas task, squeezed a few drops of fuel into each cylinder priming cup, rocked the engine back and forth to draw fuel into the cylinders, closed the cups, rocked the engine again, and fired the ignition spark.

<BR>
<BR>
The three year association [with Sears] cost Cummins Engine Company several thousand dollars.  [On a recession in 1920-1921 and farmers returning their engines to Sears after harvesting season due to a misuse of a Sears loophole.] Prices had to be slashed to get business at all, and we were caught with a heavy inventory on our hands.
<BR><a href="clessie-cummins-quotes.html">Clessie Cummins<a/>

Our original understanding and agreement… was that the Development Company would license various other builders and gradually build up a profitable return from royalties.
<BR><a href="clessie-cummins-quotes.html">Clessie Cummins<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1922 on fleet owners with hundreds of boat possibly switching to Cummins diesels if it performed well after he personally had to supervise the installation of a boat engine order in New Orleans] There is some very keen rivalry here amongst the boat owners, and no small amount of jealousy, which I see will work to our advantage.

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The OEDC would charge Cummins Engine no license fee and only a nominal royalty for manufacturing rights.  However because it would take several years for Cummins to repay OEDC for its work, it is considered only fair that the Development Company seek out outside licensees.  Still the OEDC would license only such sizes as the Engine Company cannot or does not care to manufacture, and [would] protect the engine company through some sort of preferential royalty arrangement.

<BR>
<BR>
[On his idea for a 6-7 hp engine similar to the original Sears model to W. G. Irwin] The beauty of this size is that there is absolutely no competition in it, except Hill.  If you do not agree with us on this… you might as well be ready to face a real session, as we have enough ammunition laid up here to snow you under.  It will be many more months before the big engine can be rolling.
<BR><a href="clessie-cummins-quotes.html">Clessie Cummins<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the opportunities in the locomotive railroad industry] When they plow a Diesel Engine into another, as they do the steam outfit occasionally, it surely means a new engine right off the bat.  The first plan is to get engines out in some manner and establish ourselves…  There are so many [diesel] failures that… they are all sceptical… It is pretty hard to sell anyone except a good friend on the oil engine idea at this time.
<BR><a href="clessie-cummins-quotes.html">Clessie Cummins<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="clessie-cummins-quotes.html">Clessie Cummins<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To W G Irwin on February 26, 1929 – six days after the Cummins Engine Company’s ten year anniversary] I have worked hard, put in long hours and have enjoyed most of it.  My salary is about what I could make in a good machine shop with no responsibility and with the knowledge that when the whistle blew, I would be free until another day.  
<BR><a href="clessie-cummins-quotes.html">Clessie Cummins<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
