Do not neglect yourself, for with neglect comes loss.  Do not imagine yourself to be less than you are, nor more than you are, but seek always to become all of which you are capable.  Do not allow yourself to become arrogant or discourteous, for both are characteristics adopted by those who seek to cover their weaknesses.  Do not spend time regretting the past, but invest that time wisely by preparing a better future.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You are deserving – you are becoming – and you shall succeed.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The fall tells us if we have really done that which is required, or if we have fooled ourselves through the temporary aesthetic of conversation and pretense … of telling ourselves we’ve worked when we haven’t.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>As you sow, so shall you reap.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Those who do not possess will always scorn the possessor.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Those who condemn the successful man or woman for their apparent good fortune or dishonesty are unaware of the price often paid for success.  They cannot see the massive disappointments, the shattered hope, or the broken dreams.  They do not understand the risks incurred in both raising and investing capital for an idea yet unproven.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The arrival of winter finds us in one of two categories: Either we are prepared or we are unprepared.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We are meant to constantly improve our conditions, ourselves, and our results.  We either improve, or we regress, for never do we remain the same.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>To those who are unprepared, the arrival of winter is a time for regret and a time for sorrow.  Having lacked the willingness to pay the pain of earlier discipline, we now pay the heavier pain of regret.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>For things or circumstances to change, human attitudes, opinions, and habits must change.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>A time for becoming wise enough to know what to say – as well as to know what to overlook and what not to say.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The teacher is always the greatest recipient of the lessons he seeks to teach to others.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>How do you build a bridge between age 12 and age 40? By remembering.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>One of the greatest gifts you can give to anyone is the gift of your attention.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The more you care, the stronger you can be.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't operate on the heart with a hatchet.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Enterprise is better than ease.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Profits are better than wages.  Wages make you a living; profits make you a fortune.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Human beings have the remarkable ability to turn nothing into something. They can turn weeds into gardens and pennies into fortunes.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Showing a profit means touching something and leaving it better than you found it.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Enterprise is the hope of our future.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Take time to gather up the past so that you will be able to draw from your experiences and invest them in the future.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't let the learning from your own experiences take too long. If you have been doing it wrong for the last ten years, I would suggest that's long enough!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Life is not just the passing of time. Life is the collection of experiences and their intensity.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It's easy to carry the past as a burden instead of a school. It's easy to let it overwhelm you instead of educate you.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Be like a sponge when it comes to each new experience. If you want to be able to express it well, you must first be able to absorb it well.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The formula for disaster is: Could + Should + Won't.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Failure is not a single, cataclysmic event. You don't fail overnight. Instead, failure is a few errors in judgement, repeated every day.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't take the casual approach to life. Casualness leads to casualties.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>It's too bad failures don't give seminars. Wouldn't that be valuable? If you meet a guy who has messed up his life for forty years, you've just got to say, "John, if I bring my journal and promise to take good notes, would you spend a day with me?"<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Inevitability is being 200 feet from Niagara Falls in a little boat with no motor and no oars.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Fascination is one step beyond interest. Interested people want to know if it works. Fascinated people want to learn how it works.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Learn how to turn frustration into fascination. You will learn more being fascinated by life than you will by being frustrated by it.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>I’m on my way to the airport to catch a plan that leaves in 45 minutes. The traffic is not moving one inch. I am now fascinated - not frustrated, but fascinated. But I must admit, it doesn't work every time.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Develop a childlike fascination with life and people.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We must all wage an intense, lifelong battle against the constant downward pull. If we relax, the bugs and the weeds of negativity will move into the garden and take away everything of value.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Humility is a virtue; timidity is a disease.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you spend five minutes complaining, you have just wasted five minutes. If you continue complaining, it won't be long before they haul you out to a financial desert and there let you choke on the dust of your own regret.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You cannot take the mild approach to the weeds in your garden. You've got to hate weeds enough to kill them. Weeds are not something you handle; weeds are something you devastate.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-16.html">16<a/>  </p><p><BR>
