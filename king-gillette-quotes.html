[‘King, you are always thinking about inventions – always trying to invent something worth while.  Why don’t you invent something like the Crown Cork which, when once used, is thrown away, so that the public has to keep on coming back for more until the end of the chapter?  For every new customer you get, you lay a permanent foundation for profit’ – William Painter (King Gillette boss at the Baltimore Seal Co)] That sounds easy, Mr Painter, but how many things are there that everybody uses like corks and pins and needles?  [‘You don’t know, King.  I don’t know.  Nobody knows.  You may not strike anything like the cork.  However, it certainly will do no harm to think about it.’ – William Painter]

As I stood there with the razor in my hand, my eyes resting on it as lightly as a bird settling down on its nest, the Gillette razor was born.  In that moment I saw it all: the way the blade could be held in a holder; the idea of sharpening the two opposite edges on the thin piece of steel; the clamping plates, with a handle halfway between the two edges of the blade.
<BR> As I stood there with the razor in my hand, my eyes resting on it as lightly as a bird settling down on its nest, the Gillette razor was born.  I saw it all in a moment… I could see the way the blade could be held in a holder; then came the idea of sharpening the two opposite edges on the thin piece of steel that was uniform in thickness throughout, thus doubling its services; and following in sequence came the clamping plates for the blade and a handle equally disposed between the two edges of the blade.

People in Western societies are slowly discovering that personal ambition and human progress don’t depend on competition between individuals for material wealth.  Under our present system, nine-tenths of the population live from hand to mouth.  The whole power of their minds is absorbed in the struggle to obtain the necessities of life from day to day, which leaves not time to develop the mind by the acquisition of knowledge.  The result is that the world loses the natural progressive power which would develop under a system which would allow for the free expansion of mind.

<BR>
<BR>
[On business leaders being the prophets of a generation] They see far into the future, and discount that future by coming to the front as promoters, and by securing options on competitive plants of industry and bringing them together…
<BR><a href="king-gillette-quotes.html">King Gillette<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1910] Each corporation formed is a more economic machine for accomplishing some definite result and a step nearer a definite economic goal, and any obstruction by law or otherwise which retards their formation or growth is the insanity of inexcusable ignorance, and criminal.  It is tantamount to using the sledge on the reaping machine, the printing-press, and dynamo, and going back to the primitive ways of our forefathers.
