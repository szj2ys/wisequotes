<BR><B>Joe Namath</B>
<BR>
<BR>
For years I have been accused of making snap judgements.  Honestly, this is not the case because I am a profound military student and the thoughts I express, perhaps too flippantly, are the result of years of thought and study.
<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/>
<BR>

If you treat your children as it they already are what they are capable of becoming, then you will be doing them a large favour in this self-confidence endeavour.
<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The positive force and negative force of a magnet cannot coexist in the same mind. Neither can faith and fear coexist in the same mind. People full of fear, worry, doubt, indecision, and other negative thinking cannot at the same time possess faith, confidence, belief and positive expectancy.
<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

If it hadn’t been for the Blue Boxes, there wouldn’t have been an Apple. I’m 100% sure of that. Woz and I learned how to work together, and we gained the confidence that we could solve technical problems and actually put something into production. You cannot believe how much confidence that gave us.
<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Many divorces are caused by the complete dependence of the female. At first there is the strong sexual attraction that sometimes masquerades a love. Everything goes well until the first financial crisis jars the man’s confidence and threatens the woman’s security. The woman can’t help. All she can be is dependent, because that is what she has been trained to be. Instead of standing beside the man, giving him encouragement by contributing her own efforts, she becomes accusatory and sullen and the sex drive that passed for love is no longer enough to satisfy either of them. If we begin to think and respond as capable human beings able to deal with an even enjoy the challenges of life, then we surely will have something more to contribute to marriage than our bodies.
<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Each time you act from a positive attitude your self-confidence is enhanced, your ability to achieve is proven and you know you can succeed.
<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Successful investors tend to be unemotional, allowing the greed and fear of others to play into their hands. By having confidence in their own analysis and judgement, they respond to market forces not with blind emotion but with calculated reason. Successful investors, for example, demonstrate caution in frothy markets and steadfast conviction in panicky ones. Indeed, the very way an investor views the market and it’s price fluctuations is a key factor in his or her ultimate investment success or failure.
<BR><a href="seth-klarman-quotes.html">Seth Klarman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Mutual confidence is the foundation of all satisfactory human relationships.
<BR><a href="napoleon-hill-quotes.html">Napoleon Hill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Self-confidence may be mistaken for egotism if it is not accompanied by humility of the heart.

<BR>
Too much self-confidence often inspires too little caution.
<BR><a href="napoleon-hill-quotes.html">Napoleon Hill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Do not doubt yourself, for where doubt resides, confidence cannot. Do not neglect yourself, for with neglect comes loss. Do not imagine yourself to be less than you are, nor more than you are, but seek always to become all of which you are capable. Do not allow yourself to become arrogant or discourteous, for both are characteristics adopted by those who seek to cover their weaknesses. Do not spend time regretting the past, but invest that time wisely by preparing a better future.
<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A man cannot be convinced against his own convictions, but he can be talked into a state of uncertainty and indecision, which is even worse, for that means that he cannot trade with confidence and comfort.
<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The fact that you are shooting adds to your self-confidence, because you feel that you are doing something, and are not sitting like a duck in a bathtub being shot at.
<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
A most personal and valuable lesson. Do not give into your fears of public prayer and speaking. Allow God to give you the voice and confidence to honor him.
<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is a great comfort to me to know that although I am not with you, yet you are in the hands of One who will not permit any evil to come nigh you. What a consoling thought it is to know that we may, with perfect confidence, commit all our friends in Jesus to the care of our Heavenly Father, with an assurance that all will be well with them!
<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I came in with a high confidence level that these were people who I could respect, and knew had the background and the inclination and the determination to do what would lie ahead.
<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
You had to sort of fill the squares and make sure you had done enough of those that you felt confident in your ability and people that were watching you on the ground, and…grading how you did. You also felt confident that you were in control of your destiny.
<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On his fathers support] Without his encouragement in the early years I don’t know if I would have developed the self-confidence to attempt such a challenging career.
<BR><a href="christopher-reeve-quotes.html">Christopher Reeve<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
If you’re in a state of confidence and positive expectancy, the decisions, you make will be quite different than if you’re feeling vulnerable and fearful.
<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On science and medicine] Young men, young men, put your confidence in these sure and powerful methods, from which we have as yet learned only the first secrets.
<BR><a href="louis-pasteur-quotes.html">Louis Pasteur<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
The price, or effort of thinking thoughts of love, prosperity, or self-confidence is no greater than the price given to thoughts of hate, poverty, or self-doubt. Only the rewards are different.
<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Every time we choose to do less than we could, this error in judgement has an effect on our self-confidence. Repeated everyday we soon find ourselves not only doing less than we should, but also being less than we could.
<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Sending people overseas is a great educational and confidence building experience for them. At all times you should have at least two people travelling overseas, learning and growing.
<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.
<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The average chart reader is apt to become obsessed with the notion that the dips and peaks and primary and secondary movements are all there is to stock speculation. If he pushes his confidence to it’s logical limit he is bound to go broke.
<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jessie Livermore<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Each time new experiments are observed to agree with the predictions the theory survives, and our confidence in it is increased; but if ever a new observation is found to disagree, we have to abandon or modify the theory. At least that is what is supposed to happen, but you can always question the competence of the person who carried out the observation.
<BR><a href="stephen-hawking-quotes.html">Stephen Hawking<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was twenty-seven years old and full of confidence, but I didn’t know the first thing about how to evaluate a proposition like this so I jumped right in with both feet. I bought it for $25,000 - $5,000 of our own money and $20,000 borrowed from Helen’s [His wife for over 50 years] father. My naiveté about contracts and such would later come back to haunt me in a big way.
<BR><a href="sam-walton-quotes.html">Sam Walton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Rather than inspiring confidence, instilling dignity and courage as had the earlier Movement, the threats of black violence culminated in crushing defeats followed inevitably by despondency, apathy and discouragement with all forms of social action. My husband had foreseen this and warned there was no greater folly than for a minority ill-prepared for warfare to seek it out against an adversity greater in number and vastly larger in fire power.
<BR><a href="coretta-scott-king-quotes.html">Coretta Scott King<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army: 1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army. 2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldiers' minds. 3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.
<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/>
