<BR>
[In July 2013.] In the future, Leatherman will always be a Portland, Oregon based company.  And will always do the vast majority of our work in Portland, Oregon.  
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2013.] Leatherman will always be the leading company in multi-tools.  It will grow through an ever broadening range of innovative complimentary products.           
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] Growing up I was in the outdoors a lot because my father used to take us fishing every weekend in the summer. We fished almost every piece of water in Oregon.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] My tool of choice at the moment is the Leatherman Charge TTi.  Charge TTi is the deluxe version of the [Leatherman] Wave, which is our most popular tool.    
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] Customer suggestions have led to some of the features of our multitools over the years, such as the corkscrew and saw.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] I've received lots of letters from people who have used a Leatherman to free wild animals caught in fencing or traps. There are numerous stories of people using a Leatherman to remove a fish hook from somewhere on their body, including when equipment at the hospital isn’t adequate. 
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] We’ve also received a tool back under warranty that had obviously stopped a bullet, and another that was dropped and then left in a vat of caustic acid for two weeks but was still obviously a multitool. 
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] Stainless steel doesn’t mean ‘no stain’, so if you use your [Leatherman] tool in a saltwater environment be sure to wash and re-oil it afterwards.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] Millions of copies come in from China but those don't bother me because the price is a tenth of ours but the quality a twentieth. If I really think about who's my biggest competitor, it's mobile technology. We have to keep an eye on changing lifestyles and technologies.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] Aussies realise that if you get yourself in a jam, it's you that's got to get yourself out of it.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013 on how many women purchase Leatherman’s compared to men.] I’d estimate that 80 per cent of our end users are male but as much as 40 per cent are purchased by women because Leatherman tools are often bought as gifts.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013 on one future vision.] I envision in the future… a Leatherman multitool will have a laser.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] We’ve come up with tools that are more targeted at action sports like skateboarding and surfing, so more specific tools for activities such as cycling or fishing is one direction for us to go in the future.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My name is on every tool.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Leatherman Tools having 25 year warranties.] Long enough to prove we stand behind our tools, but short enough to show we’re serious.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe in my employees.  I believe that I don’t just get their hands, I also get their minds.  
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Guaranteed for 25 years.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2014 on his business partner wanting to put Tim Leatherman’s name on the product.] I think he realized that if my name was on each Leatherman tool I’d want to make each one perfect.  
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On one of his ‘What is he going to do for the rest of his life?’ type of questions back in 1975.] Add pliers to a pocket knife.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2014.] The company has now been in existence for thirty years.

First year we sold 200 tools, the second year 30,000 tools the third year 70,000 160,000 and ten years after our first year we were selling more than 1,000,000 of the original Leatherman tools in one year.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The tool by the way is guaranteed for 25 years.

<BR>
[In January 2014.] I think the mindsets of Australian’s are that if you get yourself into trouble, you’re going to get yourself out of trouble.
<BR><a href="tim-leatherman-quotes.html">Tim Leatherman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was sure the only way to get it on the market was to make it myself.
