If I will, I can.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>An immediate reward for lack of discipline is a fun day at the beach.  A future reward of discipline is owning the beach.  Unfortunately, most of us would choose today’s pleasure over tomorrow’s fortune.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The keys to discipline –‘Start with the little things and work up to the big ones.’<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>I’ve discovered that you can’t change people.  They can change themselves.  Good people are found, not changed.  If you want good people, you have to find them.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>I will discipline myself to achieve my goals so in the years ahead I can celebrate my successes.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It’s not what happens in the world that determines the major part of your future.  What happens, happens to us all.  The key is what you do about it.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Happiness doesn’t come from big pieces of great success but from small, daily achievements.  What Mr (Benjamin) Franklin is saying is that we must be happy with what we’ve got when we’re in pursuit of what we really want.  Abraham Lincoln said it best.  He said, ‘You’ll be as happy as you make up your mind to be.’<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you don’t like your present address, change it – you’re not a tree!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It means that big achievements come one small step at a time.  It means that you’ve got to enjoy the journey.  It means that you must enjoy and take pride in your little accomplishments.  It means celebrating who you are becoming in pursuit of your larger goal.  And it mean’s doing so everyday.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Discipline is the requirement for progress.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Set compelling goals.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Ambitious people know that everything they do and every discipline they adhere to form the links in the chain of events that will lead them to their final destination.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The best money spent is the money spent to cultivate the genius of your own mind and spirit.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Hear or read something challenging, something instructional, at least thirty minutes a day, everyday.  You can get along without some meals, but you can’t get along without some ideas, examples and inspiration.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>When you live a very public life, you treasure solitude.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Effective brainstorming can only happen if you disassociate from your ego.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It is easy to get up in the morning when you awaken anxious to make progress towards your dreams.  When you’re excited about life, you’ll wake up long before your alarm clock goes off.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>In my mind’s eye I could picture him over the coming years, working long hours, meeting deadlines, overcoming obstacles, doing everything it takes to be successful – and doing it gladly!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Happiness is not in the getting.  Happiness is in the becoming.  Happiness is a universal quest.  Happiness is a joy that comes as a result of positive activity.  It has a wide variety of meanings, a wide variety of interpretations.  Happiness is both the joy of discovery and the joy of knowing.  It’s the joy that comes from designing a life that practices the fine art of living well.  Happiness is being able to explore all that life offers.  Happiness is quite often found in having options – options of doing what you want to, instead of doing what you have to.  The option of living where you want to, instead of living where you have to.  The option of looking like you want to, instead of settling for what you have to look like.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Happiness is receiving and sharing, reaping and bestowing.  Happiness is found in taking the time to enjoy what you’re accomplished: enjoying the plateau, giving yourself credit when credit is due, patting yourself on the back for a job well done.  Happiness is the here and now.  Happiness isn’t the end result.  Happiness is part of the journey.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>The road to heaven, is heaven.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you share a good idea often enough, it will fall on good people.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>My definition of financial independence: it’s the ability to live solely from the income of your own personal resources.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>He said Mr Rohn, the key to happiness is not more.  Happiness is an art to be studied and practiced.  More money will only make you more of what you already are and send you more quickly to your destination.  If you are inclined to be unhappy, you will be absolutely miserable if you get a lot of money.  If you are inclined to be mean, you will be a terror if you get a lot of money.  If you are inclined to drink a little too much, you will be a drunk when you get a lot of money.  More money will only make you more.  But the good news is that more money will amplify your happiness if you are inclined to be happy.  <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Success is like an ocean – it’s not in short supply.  The problem is, some people go to the ocean with a teaspoon.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You can cut a tree down with a hammer, but it takes about thirty days.  If you trade the hammer for an axe, you can cut the tree down in about thirty minutes.  The difference between the thirty minutes and thirty days is the tool.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Words are ‘bread for the head’.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The only way life gets better for you is when you get better.  Better is not something you wish for; better is something you become.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>How will my life change?  The answer is: when you change.  The only way it get’s better for you is when you get better.  Better is not something you wish for; better is something you become.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Things aren’t going to change until I change.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>You can’t change the circumstances or the seasons or the wind.  But you can change your reading habits.  <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You’ve got to be self-reliant.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The essence of life is growth.  It is doing the best you possibly can.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>When you’re focussing on growth, it’s easy to do all you can.  It’s easy to succeed.  It’s easy to have financial freedom.  The more you do, the more you get.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>A strong individual is not a rigid individual.  In fact exactly the opposite is true.  Strength comes from flexibility.  The ability to adapt.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Being self-enterprising means feeling good enough about yourself, having a great enough self-worth, to want to seek opportunities that will make a difference in the future.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>I’ve decided that enterprise is better than ease.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Ant Philosophy – Ants never quit.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Enterprising people will always find a way to take advantage of a situation, not be burdened by it.  And enterprising people aren’t lazy.  They don’t wait for opportunities to come to them, they go after the opportunities.  Enterprise means always finding a way to keep yourself actively working toward your ambition.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Once you start understanding how valuable you are, you will have many new experiences.  That’s why the understanding of self-worth plays a major role in our ability to be enterprising.  Our self-worth makes the difference being lazy and being active.  If we don’t feel good about ourselves, we won’t feel good about our lives.  And if we don’t feel good about ourselves, we won’t feel good about our lives.  And if we don’t feel good about our lives, we won’t be very interested in looking for opportunities.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-2.html">2<a/></p><p><BR>
