Our idea when we bought our first rental property was that it would be a good objective to have a clear, independent income of $102 monthly by the time I retired from the telephone company with a modest pension at sixty-five.

And sad to say, he has already gone bankrupt following his own advice!

<BR><a href="bill-nickerson-quotes.html">Bill Nickerson<a/>

<BR><a href="bill-nickerson-quotes.html">Bill Nickerson<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="bill-nickerson-quotes.html">Bill Nickerson<a/>

<BR><a href="bill-nickerson-quotes.html">Bill Nickerson<a/>
<BR>

You don’t need any lucky breaks to make money in real estate.  You don’t need a particularly high IQ.  You don’t even need a large nest egg to get yourself started on your real estate fortune.  All you need… is average intelligence, and average luck to make a million in real estate.

What is the basic difference between speculation and investment?  Investment property pays an income to help carry itself right from the beginning while you are making improvements to increase it’s value.  Buying anything with no income is pure speculation.  This applies to vacant land, to gold and silver, and to diamonds.

Both government and insurance company studies show that if you take out a mortgage to buy property, the odds are four hundred to one in your favor that it will be paid off…  If you start a new business, according to the Department of Commerce, the odds are four to one that you will go broke.  Thus your chances as a property investor are 1,600 to one better than if you start a new business.
<BR><a href="bill-nickerson-quotes.html">Bill Nickerson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What is the riskiest real estate?… any overfinanced property, bought with little or nothing down, where the loan is too big for you to make the payments.

<BR>
<BR>
The worst specific sucker bait for the average investor is buying a resort… A reporter asked two resort owners, ‘What would you do if I gave you $1 million?’  One resort operator said, ‘I’d quit work and go fishing every day, take it easy and live off the income the rest of my life.’  The second owner said, ‘I’d just keep on running my resort till my million was all gone!’
<BR><a href="bill-nickerson-quotes.html">Bill Nickerson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There are many ways… to make a fortune, but investment in fixer-upper rental dwellings is the surest road, meeting a vital necessity of life.
<BR><a href="bill-nickerson-quotes.html">Bill Nickerson<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="bill-nickerson-quotes.html">Bill Nickerson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have learned that it pays to study a problem, then put it aside and let your subconscious help find the answer.  When an answer comes in the middle of the night, it pay s to get up and write the inspiration down.  You can sleep better afterward, and your solution is still there and not lost in the cold light of morning.
<BR><a href="bill-nickerson-quotes.html">Bill Nickerson<a/>
