Among the things we should have anticipated was the massive blow-out in interest rates in the 1980s – we had the opportunity to restructure debt to equity ratios then, but we didn’t.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Even when I was 21 I was a global player, always thinking of the bigger markets and the power you achieve if you can control the market.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>

From the very start my business philosophy was to develop businesses with cash flow and to buy assets that we could substantially increase in value, for example buying a raw piece of land and developing it or having its zoning changed.  
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

You… wonder what went wrong and why you are in prison when other people are still walking the streets freely after having failed in their business and gone bankrupt, or when company directors have lost billions of shareholders’ dollars.

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Look what happened to AMP in Australia when in two years to mid-2003 more than $15 billion of shareholders’ funds were written off the value of the company.  I ask, could they survive a Sultan-type inquiry after that?  Probably not.

<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I… felt for the poor pit ponies – little Welsh ponies bred specially to work in the mines – that were trudging along underground, heads down, dragging the heavily laden trolleys… They never saw the light of day, something a six year old struggled to comprehend.

<BR>
<BR>
[On his mother’s money management after they moved from English to Australia when he was 11 years old due to the health of his father needing a warmer climate] From the outset she very wisely invested any spare money we had in stocks and shares, and later she invested 1,500 pounds in a block of land at Melville, on the highway leading into Perth.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

[His dry cleaning boss in his early years] He said to me one day: ‘Alan, I want to tell you something; you earn 7 percent on your money and you sleep well.  But if you earn 12 percent on your money, you eat well.  It is up to you, how much you want to eat.’
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[His dry cleaning boss whilst building another block of units] He said to me ‘If you build a straight line with no indents then you need fewer bricks, so you build it cheaper.  If you don’t have overhangs and only fit gutters then you save on that much timber on the eaves.  And if you have bricks on the outside and bricks on the inside, there’s no maintenance.  Bricks are very good.’
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>

<BR>
All the bloody flats he built were just brick walls – no maintenance, no painting and no plastering.  He’d put down parquetry flooring.  He also explained that as windows were very expensive, to make sure to only use the standard size, and to make sure the sill comes with the window because then you don’t pay for the sill.  He built many blocks of flats around Perth, keeping all of them as rental properties.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>

<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To the biggest brickworks in Perth] You have all these bricks stockpiled in the yard that are going to take a long time to be used, so why not give them to me on credit so I can put them into a building.  I’ll pay you for them as soon as I get the money out.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On dealing with Leonard George Casley of Hutt River Province] He had a glass eye, and I can’t tell you how difficult it was dealing with him because you never knew which eye was looking at you.  One minute you’d think it was his left eye, and then you’d say to yourself ‘oops, no, it’s the other one’.  It was very disconcerting.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was a risk taker, but what many people didn’t realise was that I only took on calculated risks.

<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s very well to criticise other people, but if you want to change thing sthen you’d better get in there and do some of the work yourself.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
