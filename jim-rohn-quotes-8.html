It's easy to give ten cents out of a dollar; it's a little harder to give a hundred thousand out of a million.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Giving is better than receiving because giving starts the receiving process.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Nothing teaches character better than generosity.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Here's what is exciting about sharing ideas with others: If you share a new idea with ten people, they get to hear it once and you get to hear it ten times.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Sharing makes you bigger than you are. The more you pour out, the more life will be able to pour in.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Somebody says, "Well, I can't be concerned about other people. About the best I can do is to take care of myself" Well, then you will always be poor.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>What you give becomes an investment that will return to you multiplied at some point in the future.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>When somebody shares, everybody wins.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The amount you give isn't important. What matters is what that amounts represents in terms of your life.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Only by giving are you able to receive more than you already have.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Goals. There's no telling what you can do when you get inspired by them. There's no telling what you can do when you believe in them. And there's no telling what will happen when you act upon them.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't set your goals too low. If you don't need much, you won't become much.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We all have two choices: We can make a living or we can design a life.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We all need lots of powerful long-range goals to help us past the short-term obstacles.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it. What it makes of you will always be the far greater value than what you get.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The ultimate reason for setting goals is to entice you to become the person it takes to achieve them.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>When Andrew Carnegie died, they discovered a sheet of paper upon which he had written one of the major goals of his life: to spend the first half of his life accumulating money and to spend the last half of his life giving it all away.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Some people are disturbed by those tough days because all they have is the days. They haven't designed or described or defined the future.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It can be dangerous to weaken the strong in our attempts to strengthen the weak.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>One of the great liberal documents of the world is the Declaration of Independence. One of the great conservative documents of the world is the Constitution of the United States. We need both documents to build a country. One to get it started - liberal. And the other to help maintain the structure over the years - conservative.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Beware of those who seek to take care of you lest your caretakers become your jailers.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Taxes are our way of feeding the goose that lays the golden eggs of freedom, democracy, and enterprise. Someone says, "Well, the goose eats too much." That's probably true. But better a fat goose than no goose at all!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Tyranny knows no restraint of appetite.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Did you ever eat a government cookie? The real genius to make a marketplace flourish does not come from the government, it comes from the genius of the people.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>An ancient script asks, "Would you let a man rule the city who cannot even rule his own spirit?" Sometimes we do.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You cannot base your life on what the government does or how your tax dollars are being spent. You've got to vote well, and then chart your own course; vote well, and then take charge of your own life.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Sure the government has some pounds to lose, but don't we all? Let not one appetite accuse another.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Learn how to be happy with what you have while you pursue all that you want.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>How sad to see a father with money and no joy. The man studied economics, but never studied happiness.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Some people don't do well simply because they don't feel well.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Some people take better care of their pets than they do themselves. Their animals can run like the wind and they can barely make it up a flight of stairs.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Make sure the outside of you is a good reflection of the inside of you.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Treat your body like a temple, not a woodshed. The mind and the body work together. Your body needs to be a good support system for the mind and the spirit. If you take good care of it, your body can take you wherever you want to go, with the power and strength and energy and vitality you will need to get there.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Take good care of your body. It's the only place you have to live.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you wish to find, you must search. Rarely does a good idea interrupt you.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Ideas can be life-changing. Sometimes all you need to open the door is just one more good idea.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Ideas are information taking shape.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>When a new idea comes our way, we must put it on our mental scales and weigh it carefully before deciding its value.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-16.html">16<a/>  </p><p><BR>
