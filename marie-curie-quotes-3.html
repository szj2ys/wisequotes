Pierre, what form do you imagine It will take?  [Pierre answered ‘I don’t know.  I should like it to have a very beautiful color…’]Our life is always the same.  We work a lot but we sleep well, so our health does not suffer.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> I often think of my isolation with grief.  I cannot complain of anything else, for our health is not bad, the child is growing well, and I have the best husband one could dream of; I could never have imagined finding one like him.  He is a true gift of heaven, and the more we live together the more we love each other.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> I have literally not a penny – not one!  I shall probably not write to you again until the holidays, unless by some chance a stamp should fall into my hands.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> The real purpose of this letter is to wish you a happy birthday, but if I am late it is only because of the lack of money and stamps, which afflicts me dreadfully – and I’ve never yet learned to ask for them.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> Often I hide my deep lack of gaiety under laughter.  This is something I learned to do when I found out that creatures who feel as keenly as I do, and are unable to change this characteristic of their nature, have to dissimulate it at least as much as possible.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> I am working a thousand times as hard as at the beginning of my stay…<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> [On getting engaged] Fate has made us deeply attached to each other and we cannot endure the idea of separating.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> The fatigue resulting from an effort which surpassed our strength, and which had been imposed upon us by the unsatisfactory physical conditions of our work, was increased by the invasion of publicity.  The shattering of our voluntary isolation was a cause of real suffering to us and had all the effects of a disaster.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> Our work on radioactivity began in solitude…<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>Don’t light the lamps!  Do you remember the day when you said to me ‘I should like radium to have a beautiful color?’<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> We are inundated with letters and with visits from photographers and journalists.  One would like to dig into the ground somewhere to find a little peace.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> With much effort we have avoided the banquets people wanted to organize in our honor.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> We have been given half of the nobel prize.  I don’t know when we shall get the money.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> If only you knew how much time, patience and money must be spent to extract this tiny amount of radium from several tons of matter!<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> Pierre is dead?  Dead?  Absolutely dead?<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> On the Sunday morning after your death, Pierre, I went to the laboratory with Jacques [Pierre’s brother] for the first time.  I tried to make a measurement, for a graph on which we had each made several points.  But I felt the impossibility of going on.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> [On her husband dying] I don’t want a pension, I am young enough to earn my living and that of my children.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> [On keeping on going after her husbands death] I will try.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> The last years of Pierre Curie’s life were very productive.  His intellectual faculties were in full development, as well as his experimental skill.  A new period of his life was about to open: it would have been, with more powerful means of action, the natural prolongation of an admirable scientific career.  Fate did not wish it thus, and we are obliged to bow before its incomprehensible decision.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>[During World War I whilst nursing] We can hear the cannon rumbling almost constantly.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> [On explaining the Roentgen X-Ray apparatus to wounded patients] You’ll see, it’s just the same as a photograph.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> Born in servitude and chained since birth, we have seen that resurrection of our country which has been our dream. We did not hope to live to this moment ourselves; we thought it might not even be given to our children to see it – and it is here!  It is true that our country has paid dear for this happiness, and that it will have to pay again.  But can the clouds of the present situation  be compared with the bitterness and discouragement that would have crushed us if, after the war, Poland had remained in chains and divided into pieces?  Like you, I have faith in the future.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> The children don’t know anything but their mothers think they’ve brought us solomons…<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> Private schools directed by Poles, were closely watched by the police and overburdened with the necessity of teaching the Russian language even to children so young that they could scarcely speak their native Polish.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> [In response to her teacher forbiding her to ‘look down’ on here despite being a head shorter] The fact is I can’t do anything else!<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> There are always more petty annoyances with the babas [busybodies] but I, even I, keep a sort of hope that I shall not disappear completely into nothingness.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> I am learning chemistry from a book; you can imagine how little I get out of that, but what can I do, as I have no place to make experiments or do practical work?<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> You tell me you have lived through the happiest week of your life; and I during these holidays, have been through such weeks as you will never know.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> There is also the need of new impressions; the need of change, of moment and life, which seizes me sometimes with such force…<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>My journey went off all right, in spite of my tragic presentiments… Nobody robbed me, or even tried to; I did not take the wrong train at any of my five changes, and I ate up all my serdelki [a polish sausage] only the rolls and the caramels were too much for me…<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> The lilacs and the fruit trees, even the apples, were in full bloom and the air was filled with the scent of flowers.  In Paris, the trees get green as early as the beginning of April.  Now the leaves have sprung out and the chestnuts are blooming.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> A touching desire to know all that was dear to me.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> The weather is beautiful today, the sun in shining and it’s warm.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> I don’t want to interfere with my child’s development for anything on earth.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> Extremely handicapped by inadequate conditions, by the lack of a proper place to work in, by the lack of money and of personnel.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> Now you are in the possession of salts of pure radium!  If you consider the amount of work that has been spent to obtain it, it is certainly the most costly of chemical elements!  What a pity it is that this work has only theoretical interest, as it seems.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> I was very touched by all that you told me of the struggle of English women for their rights, I admire them very much and I wish for their success.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> This chemistry of the invisible.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR> Radium therapy is a method of great value whose principles, technique and application originated in France.<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="marie-curie-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="marie-curie-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="marie-curie-quotes-4.html">4<a/> </p><p><BR>
