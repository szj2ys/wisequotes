He’s not making art, he’s making sh*t.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>If it could save a person’s life, would you find a way to shave ten seconds off the boot time?  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’ve learned over the years when you have really good people you don’t have to baby them.  By expecting them to do great things, you can get them to do great things.  The original Mac team taught me that A-plus players like to work together, and they don’t like it if you tolerate B work.  Ask any member of that Mac team.  They will tell you it was worth the pain.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The future isn’t what it used to be.  The current wave of industrial design is Sony’s high-tech look, which is gunmetal gray, maybe paint it black, do weird stuff to it.  It’s easy to do that.  But it’s not great.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>What we’re going to do is make the products high-tech.  We will fit them in a small package, and then we can make them beautiful and white, just like Braun does with its electronics.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We will make them bright and pure and honest about being high-tech, rather than a heavy industrial look of black, black, black, black like Sony.  So that’s our approach.  Very simple, and we’re really shooting for Museum of Modern Art quality.  The way we’re running the company, the product design, the advertising, it all comes down to this:  Let’s make it simple.  Really simple.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The main thing in our design is that we have to make things intuitively obvious.  People know how to deal with a desktop intuitively.  If you walk into an office, there are papers on the desk.  The one on the top is the most important.  People know how to switch priority.  Part of the reason we model our computers on metaphors like the desktop is that we can leverage the experience people already have.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>I have always found Buddhism, Japanese Zen Buddhism in particular to be aesthetically sublime.  The most sublime thing I’ve ever seen are the gardens around Kyoto.  I’m deeply moved by what that culture has produced, and it’s directly from Zen Buddhism.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Macintosh style] We need it to have a classic look that won’t go out of style, like the Volkswagen Beetle.  Not a Ferrari, that’s not right either.  It should be more like a Porsche!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Great art stretches the taste, it doesn’t follow tastes.  Over the years, they’ve made the lines softer but the details starker.  That’s what we have to do with the Macintosh.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It’s way too boxy, it’s got to be more curvaceous.  The radius of the first chamfer needs to be bigger, and I don’t like the size of the bevel.  It’s a start.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Well, circles and ovals are good.  But how about drawing rectangles with rounded corners?    Rectangles are everywhere!  Just look around this room!  And look outside, there’s even more, practically everywhere you look!  Within three blocks, we found seventeen examples.  I started pointing them out everywhere until he was completely convinced.   <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On his calligraphy class] When we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On tweaking the title bar] Can you imagine looking at that every day?  It’s not just a little thing, it’s something we have to do right.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Well, it’s a start.  But basically, it stinks.  The background color is too dark, some lines are the wrong thickness, and the buttons are too big.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Yes, this is it!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>That part’s really pretty.  But look at the memory chips.  That’s ugly.  The lines are too close together.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>I want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it’s inside the box.  A great carpenter isn’t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody’s going to see it.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it.  You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back.  For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Real artists sign their work.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>If, for some reason, we make some giant mistakes and IBM wins, my personal feeling is that we are going to enter sort of a computer Dark Ages for about twenty years.  Once IBM gains control of a market sector, they almost always stop innovation.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>IBM was essentially Microsoft at its worst.  They were not a force for innovation; they were a force for evil.  They were like ATT or Microsoft or Google is.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Apple II] We don’t have control, and look at all these crazy things people are trying to do to it.  That’s a mistake I’ll never make again.  We’re going to design this thing so nobody but Apple employees can get inside this box.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Time decided they were going to make me Man of the Year, and I was twenty-seven, so I actually cared about stuff like that.  I thought it was pretty cool.  They sent out Mike Moritz to write a story.  We’re the same age, and I had been very successful, and I could tell he was jealous and there was an edge to him.  He wrote this terrible hatchet job.  So the editors in New York get this story and say, ‘We can’t make this guy Man of the Year.’  That really hurt.  But it was a good lesson.  It taught me to never get too excited about things like that, since the media is a circus anyway.  They FedExed me the magazine, and I remember opening the package, thoroughly expecting to see my mug on the cover, and it was this computer sculpture thing.  I though, ‘Huh?’  And then I read the article, and it was so awful that I actually cried.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>When it comes out, Mac is going to be the most incredible computer in the world.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[Apple Lisa] It was too expensive, and we were trying to sell it to big companies when our expertise was selling to consumers.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>How old were you when you lost your virginity?  ‘What did you say?’ [Said a job candidate]   Are you are virgin?  How many times have you taken LSD?  Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.  ‘I guess I’m not the right guy.’<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Don’t compromise.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Insanely great.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On shipping the Mac late] It would be better to miss than to turn out the wrong thing.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The journey is the reward.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On doing market research] No, because customers don’t know what they want until we’ve shown them.  Do you want to see something neat?  This is my dream of what we will be making in the mid- to late eighties.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>As every day passes, the work fifty people are doing here is going to send a giant ripple through the universe.  I know I might be a little hard to get a long with, but this is the most fun thing I’ve done in my life.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Real artists ship.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I don’t have time to deal with this now.  I have sixty other people out there who are pouring their hearts into the Macintosh, and they’re waiting for me to start the meeting.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We were the renegades, and we wanted people to know it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>What are you showing me this for?  This is a piece of crap!  Anybody could build a better drive than this.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-16.html">16<a/> </p><p><BR>
