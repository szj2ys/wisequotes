<BR>
I didn’t really have any idea of what Hollywood was except that it was a place where the made movies.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My dream was to make $1,000 a week, have a Cadillac convertible and an apartment on Ocean Park where I would’ve thought that would be nirvana.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being told that he should be an agent with him having no acting ‘gifts’.  And saying that you need to know absolutely nothing to be an agent.] I thought that’s the job for me.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his first job in the mailroom of William Morris a casting agency] It was the first time in the my life that I thought ‘I can do that.’
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I used to be able to read memo’s upside down… It was like going to the college of the entertainment business.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I probably didn’t handle things as diplomatically as I should.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I totally believed that I could bring her to the world.  
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being partners with Laura Nyro in Tuna Fish Music (Laura’s favorite food was Tuna Fish)] We became partners in this new publishing company.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Laura Nyro] Anything she wanted, I wanted to get for her.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[‘Why don’t you manage me’ – Laura Nyro] Eventually I thought do I really believe that she could be one of the biggest stars in the world?  Should I give up my career at this point in my life, where I’m doing so well, and put all my marbles in Laura’s [Nyro] basket?  And I woke up one morning and I thought if you really believe it – go for it.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I think everybody thought I was crazy that I quit my job and started a management company in which I was managing one client – Laura Nyro.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I thought Laura’s record was going to be huge… It was not successful it sold something like 20 or 30,000 albums.  Laura lacked a certain level of ambition and didn’t really want to do the things that people do to become known.  So I thought I’d better get people to record these songs and make them hits so that people will see that she’s a great songwriter.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Everybody was recording Laura Nyro’s songs and all of a sudden she was a very successful song-writer.  And beginning to become hot.  She had three songs in the top ten at one time…
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Laura Nyro] I said to Laura ‘You know Laura, I think we should sell your music publishing company.  I think right now is the right time you have three songs in the top ten this may never happen again and I think we can get a lot of money for it.’  And I made a deal with Clive Davis to sell Tuna Fish Music for $4 million.  And that was a hell of a lot of money in 1969.  It made her famous, it made her rich.  It got people to listen to her music with her singing.  
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On learning negotiation skills from his mother] People would roll their eyes when my mother walked into the store.  She was a nightmare in that regard. 
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his mother’s adversity] She had a very difficult beginning… All of my mothers family were killed… and she came to America at the time of the depression.  It was not an easy life at all.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My mother was an entrepreneur… She found being on relief humiliating.  She built this business from scratch…  In 1951 my mother opened this store…
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his mother] She certainly ran her own race… I thought my mother was nuts.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There was no word dyslexia when I was a kid.  You were just dumb.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On school] Not only did I know that I wasn’t one of the smart kids in the class, but so did everyone else.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My life is a success – I am a happy man.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve always thought that each person invented himself for whatever reasons, for whatever circumstances, through whatever he has gone through, that we are each a figment of our own imagination.  And some people have a greater ability to imagine than others.
<BR><a href="david-geffen-quotes.html">David Geffen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you really believe it – go for it.
