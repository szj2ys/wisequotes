<p>120 Happiness Quotes</p><p><a href="happiness-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="happiness-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="happiness-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="4347677141";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Happiest are the people who give most happiness to others.<BR><B>Denis Diderot</B><BR><BR>The biggest enterprise, and the only one we should take seriously, is to live happily.<BR><B>Voltaire</B><BR><BR>Happiness doesn’t depend on any external conditions, it is governed by our mental attitude.<BR><B>Dale Carnegie</B><BR><BR>Money and time are the heaviest burdens in life:  And among mortals, those who are most unhappy are the ones who have more than they need.<BR><B>Samuel Johnson</B><BR><BR>One can bear anything, except continual prosperity.<BR><B>Goethe</B><BR><BR>Money doesn’t make those who don’t have any happy.<BR><B>Boris Vian</B><BR><BR>Money never prevented anybody from being happy or unhappy.<BR><B>Eddie Barclay</B><BR><BR>Our contentment doesn’t depend on what we do, or on where we find ourselves; it depends on what we think.<BR><B>Dale Carnegie</B><BR><BR>A person who is not content with others is never content with himself.<BR><B>Alain</B><BR><BR>You should always tell yourself, ‘it’s not at all because of my success that I’m content, it’s because I was content that I succeed.’<BR><B>Alain</B><BR><BR><BR><BR>Happiness doesn’t come from big pieces of great success but from small, daily achievements. What Mr (Benjamin) Franklin is saying is that we must be happy with what we’ve got when we’re in pursuit of what we really want. Abraham Lincoln said it best. He said, ‘You’ll be as happy as you make up your mind to be.’<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Happiness is receiving and sharing, reaping and bestowing. Happiness is found in taking the time to enjoy what you’re accomplished: enjoying the plateau, giving yourself credit when credit is due, patting yourself on the back for a job well done. Happiness is the here and now. Happiness isn’t the end result. Happiness is part of the journey.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>He said Mr Rohn, the key to happiness is not more. Happiness is an art to be studied and practiced. More money will only make you more of what you already are and send you more quickly to your destination. If you are inclined to be unhappy, you will be absolutely miserable if you get a lot of money. If you are inclined to be mean, you will be a terror if you get a lot of money. If you are inclined to drink a little too much, you will be a drunk when you get a lot of money. More money will only make you more. But the good news is that more money will amplify your happiness if you are inclined to be happy. <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Happiness is an art study it!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The greatest source of unhappiness comes from the inside.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Happiness is the art of learning how to get joy from your substance.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Be happy with what you have while pursuing what you want. The key to happiness is not more.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Happiness is always a by-product.<BR><a href="john-templeton-quotes.html">John Templeton<a/><BR><BR> Happiness is not a when or a where; it can be a here and a now.<BR><a href="zig-ziglar-quotes.html">Zig Ziglar<a/><BR><BR> Can you set happiness as a goal?<BR><a href="zig-ziglar-quotes.html">Zig Ziglar<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>It is impossible to grant someone happiness. The best you can do… is to give him the freedom to pursue happiness. Happiness is not a tangible thing, it’s a by product – a by product of achievement.<BR><a href="ray-kroc-quotes.html">Ray Kroc<a/><BR><BR> When all is said and done, success without happiness is the worst kind of failure.<BR><a href="og-mandino-quotes.html">Og Mandino<a/><BR><BR>Success, love, happiness, contentment, wealth … if these are the things you want… their roots all grow from seeds of thought, seeds that only you can plant now…<BR><a href="og-mandino-quotes.html">Og Mandino<a/><BR><BR>Some people accumulate money so they can convert it into happiness, but the wiser ones accumulate happiness so they can give it away and still have it in abundance.<BR><a href="napoleon-hill-quotes.html">Napoleon Hill<a/><BR><BR>Happiness can be multiplied by sharing it with others without diminishing the original source. It is the one asset which increases when it is given away.<BR><a href="napoleon-hill-quotes.html">Napoleon Hill<a/><BR><BR>You can't find happiness by robbing another of it. Ditto for economic security.<BR><a href="napoleon-hill-quotes.html">Napoleon Hill<a/><BR><BR>Having the right attitude is an essential prerequisite for success and happiness. The right attitude is one of the fundamentals of the good life. That is why we must constantly examine our feelings about our role in the world and about our possibilities for achieving our dreams.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Many have learned to earn well, but they have not yet learned to live well. It is as though they have decided to wait until they become wealthy before they start practicing sophistication. What they fail to understand is that practiced sophistication is as much a cause of wealth as it is a result of wealth. Until they have discovered that happiness is part of the cause and that wealth is merely an effect, their circumstances are not likely to change.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Each of us can design our own life happiness.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>There are seeds of self-destruction in all of us that will bear only unhappiness if allowed to grow.<BR><a href="og-mandino-quotes.html">Og Mandino<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Very often we are our own worst enemy as we foolishly build stumbling blocks on the path that leads to success and happiness.<BR><a href="og-mandino-quotes.html">Og Mandino<a/><BR><BR>Happiness is not a station at which you arrive, but a manner of travelling.<BR><a href="zig-ziglar-quotes.html">Zig Ziglar<a/><BR><BR> All the Declaration of Independence proclaims is the right to pursue happiness; you have to catch up with it yourself.<BR><a href="zig-ziglar-quotes.html">Zig Ziglar<a/><BR><BR> Happiness is not pleasure, it is victory.<BR><a href="zig-ziglar-quotes.html">Zig Ziglar<a/><BR><BR> Success and happiness are not destinations, they’re exciting, never-ending journeys.<BR><a href="zig-ziglar-quotes.html">Zig Ziglar<a/><BR><BR> Success and happiness are often coupled as goals, as if the attainment of the first automatically guaranteed the second. No so. All of us know successful individuals who are miserable.<BR><a href="og-mandino-quotes.html">Og Mandino<a/><BR><BR>It may be praiseworthy and noble to sacrifice your life to a cause or a business or the happiness of others, but if you are miserable and unfulfilled in that lifestyle, and know it, then to remain in it is a hypocrisy…<BR><a href="og-mandino-quotes.html">Og Mandino<a/><BR><BR>Every action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind … what we sow is what we reap. When we choose actions that bring happiness and success to others, the fruit of our karma is happiness and success.<BR><a href="deepak-chopra-quotes.html">Deepak Chopra<a/><BR><BR>Happiness is not in the getting. Happiness is in the becoming. Happiness is a universal quest. Happiness is a joy that comes as a result of positive activity. It has a wide variety of meanings, a wide variety of interpretations. Happiness is both the joy of discovery and the joy of knowing. It’s the joy that comes from designing a life that practices the fine art of living well. Happiness is being able to explore all that life offers. Happiness is quite often found in having options – options of doing what you want to, instead of doing what you have to. The option of living where you want to, instead of living where you have to. The option of looking like you want to, instead of settling for what you have to look like.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>I have always believe that each man makes his own happiness and is responsible for his own problems. It is a simple philosophy.<BR><a href="ray-kroc-quotes.html">Ray Kroc<a/><BR><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="happiness-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="happiness-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="happiness-quotes-3.html">3<a/> </p><p><BR> </p><p>
