In the past years, when the stock market, the property market and the general economy were in the doldrums, we increased our investments.  One of the reasons was that we are always prepared.  We don’t get carried away when times are good and don’t get too pessimistic when times are bad.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is the man who goes to the table to ask and squeeze for the last nickel who is never happy.  Do you know why?  It is because that person leaves the table, typically getting the nickel, but then hates himself for not asking for two nickels.  As a result, he is never happy.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[What his father Yun-jing Li told him on his deathbed] You must have the strength of character.  Then you can rise as tall as the sky.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>

People were working eight hours a day, but I worked sixteen hours… It was really full, non-stop work.  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>

<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>

I loathe the social scene; I don’t like cultivating relationships, and I’m too emotional.  These are all weaknesses in doing business.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I also have some strengths.  First, I have a thirst for knowledge.  Second, I work hard, which can compensate for some of the weaknesses.  Most importantly, I know what’s right from wrong.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

Is it always set eight minutes fast?… Do you still live in the same house you have lived in for 20 years?’] Except for the fact that my watch clocks a full 20 minutes ahead, your facts are basically correct.
