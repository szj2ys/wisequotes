Being depressed is a habit.  Being lazy is a habit.  Being limited is a habit.  These, and many other personality traits, result from the way in which you use your mind.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>The ancient sages called the aging process a mistake of the intellect.  Aging is the forgetting of how to make things right within a cell.  It is not normal, it simply is a learned way of being.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>The world is in you, and if you can work your mind in a genuinely magical sense, you can strongly affect the aging process of the cells composed of indestructible DNA.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Your emotions are physical manifestations of your thoughts.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>You are the creator of your emotions.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>If you want to know what your thoughts were like yesterday, look at your body today.  If you want to know what your body will be like tomorrow, look at your thoughts today.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Emotions show up in your body as physical manifestations of your thoughts.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Your biggest hurdle to reshaping your personality into the work of art that you desire will be overcoming your fears and doubts.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Fear of death can be a great inhibitor in your life.  It can keep you from living fully and it can make your time here in this human form anxious and sickly.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Your fear is a thought.  It is invisible.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Remove all doubt about what kind of person you can become.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Stay focused on what you are for, rather than what you are against.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Act in your physical world as if that person whom you would love to be were already here.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>I had already seen it in my mind, and I knew that it would be so.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>I had already known it in my mind, and I acted as if it were a reality long before it was manifested in the physical world.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>To die while you are alive is an enormously enlightening experience.  The experience removes your fears and teaches you who you really are.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Your miracles are an inside job.  Go there to create the magic that you seek in your life.  That is indeed your only reality.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>There is no reality except the one contained within us.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Anything that has been accomplished by any other human being in the physical realm is within the field of possibility.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Defining your miracle is the first step toward making it your reality.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>As you think, so shall you be.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>There is nothing to stop you from converting your illness to wellness.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Know that your life has a purpose.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Overcome weakness by leaving it behind.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>All that you are capable or incapable of achieving flows from what you have decided within that invisible sphere called your mind, where all of your thoughts originate, and where your physical reality ultimately originates as well.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Don’t demand anything, loosen up and be willing to allow a miracle to happen without any insistence and then everything will come to you that you need.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Access the higher part of yourself and know you are not alone.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>You will find yourself believing there is nothing you cannot accomplish if you put your mind to it and believe it.  This is the inner circuitry of a miracle worker.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>You don’t need another body, you need to trust in the divine intelligence inhabiting the one you already have.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>You can be a messenger of miracles to the world.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Your thoughts create either prosperity or scarcity in your life.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>We can create thought.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>We become what we think about all day long.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Our lives are what our thoughts create.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Not only do you become what you think about, but the world also becomes what you think about.  Those who think that the world is a dark place are blind to the light that might illuminate their lives.  Those who see the light of the world view the dark spots are merely potential light.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>The earth does not belong to man, man belongs to the earth.  All things are connected like the blood that unites us all.  Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it.  Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>If I am here, everyone is here.
