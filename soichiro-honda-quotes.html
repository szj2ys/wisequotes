There are a lot of cars that need to be repaired in this country.’  I didn’t listen to them, and despite their pessimistic advice I created, on the 24th of September, 1948, next door to my research laboratory, the Honda Motor Company, which today is successful around the world.

[On Napoleon] I imagined him to have a physique as imposing and strong as his reputation merited.  When I discovered from reading history books that he was a small man, I was not at all disillusioned.  I’m not very big myself, and it was obvious that you don’t measure a man’s greatness by his physical size, but by his acts, by the impact he makes on human history.  I also learned that Napoleon was of humble origin, that probably his family was very poor.  So it wasn’t necessary to be born a nobleman or rich to succeed in life.  There are other qualities which also lead to success.  Courage, perseverance, the ability to dream and to persevere.

So she ended up by respecting my work and letting me finish what I had to do.  Even hunger could not disturb me.

<BR>
<BR>

I finally became an independent man, a real man, master of his legs, head, destiny, of his timetable and the risks he knew he should take.
<BR><a href="soichiro-honda-quotes.html">Soichiro Honda<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A lot of my friends top me I’d be better off staying in my garage, growing little by little, letting my business prosper in this way rather than undertaking risky adventures.  I had invested all my savings into this operation.  I felt responsible to those with whom I’d gotten involved, and I said to myself that by closing my garage at the age of 30, I had perhaps missed my chance and sunk my own ship.
<BR><a href="soichiro-honda-quotes.html">Soichiro Honda<a/>

When I take stock of life, I realize how important the personal contact is, how much more they are worth than the invention of machines, because [people] allow us to expand our view of things, and open up thousands of experiences which we would otherwise be unable to understand.
