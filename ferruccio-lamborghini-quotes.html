[At the age of 75] When you stop working, you start to die!
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Enzo Ferrari saying] ‘Lamborghini, you may be able to drive a tractor but you will never be able to handle a Ferrari Properly.'  This was the point when I finally decided to make a perfect car.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the embryo to form Lamborghini when he owned a Ferrari and a Maserati amongst other cars] One day I had a bit of an argument with my friend Enzo Ferrari, who reckoned I wasn’t able to drive a Ferrari, only tractors.  That’s when I got the idea into my head and told myself – I’ll make the cars myself from now on!
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
All my Ferraris had clutch problems…   The problem with the clutch was never cured, so I decided to talk to Enzo Ferrari. I had to wait for him a very long time. 'Ferrari, your cars are rubbish!' I complained. Il Commendatore was furious.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On not being listened to by Ferrari] Finally I'd had enough. I slammed the door and vowed I would build my own car. The way I wanted it.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had never stopped thinking about the ideal motor car… All I had to do was construct a plant to build it.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At the age of 68] When I miss the sound and the fury, I take refuge in my garage and turn the key in the ignition of my Miura…
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On what type of man he is.] A man who likes creating things.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Mechanics was in my blood.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had to try something new.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the first Lamborghini in 1963] One kilometer in 27 seconds, start to finish!
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Enzo Ferrari] Ferrari never spoke to me again. He was a great man, I admit, but it was so very easy to upset him.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
'You know how to drive a tractor, but you’ll never learn to drive a Ferrari'  If Enzo Ferrari hadn't made that crack - one day early in the 1960's when I was complaining for the nth time about the insoluble clutch problems I was having with his car, I might never have built my Lamborghinis.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I liked my Ferraris, but I was sick and tired of spending so much of my time burning out their clutches…
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On building the Lamborghini] It’s very simple.  In the past, I have bought some of the most famous Gran Turismo cars and in each of these magnificent machines I have found some faults.  Too hot.  Or uncomfortable.  Or not sufficiently fast.  Or not perfectly finished.  Now I want to make a GT car without faults.  Not a technical bomb.  Very normal.  Very conventional.  But a perfect car.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Everything went like a dream for three-quarters of the race-until we ran off the road.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Adolfo Orsi the owner then of Maserati] The owner of Maserati, was a man I had a lot of respect for: he had started life as a poor boy, like myself. But I did not like his cars much.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My Ferrari was at least 25kph faster than theirs thanks to our four-cam conversion. 'Hey, Lamborghini, what have you done to your car?' they would ask me later 'Oh, I don't know' I used to answer with a grin!
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People will talk about it for long after they have forgotten who won the race.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Look at that idiot over there – he’s lost the keys!

<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>

I was born in 1916 into a family of modest farmers.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Lamborghini engineers] An entire team of engineers, as brilliant as they were opinionated…
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his vision for the first Lamborghini] I wanted a compact, elegant car with twelve cylinders of high cubic capacity, four carburetors and large valves. A sturdy machine, with drysump lubrication.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When people ask me nowadays to describe my ideal car. I still answer with one word: Miura.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1962 on the Lamborghini emblem] I visited Eduardo Miura’s ranch in Seville where he raised bulls for bullfighting, and I was so impressed that by the time I got home I had already selected my future emblem.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At the age of 68 about starting another car company] If I could find nine partners as determined as my son, I’d forget my age and start from nothing.  And I bet the glory days of the 1960’s would rally round us again very quickly.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>

Times have changed.  Today I would not adventure alone. It’s too difficult and too risky. Still…
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the success of the 1966 Monte Carlo Grand Prix where he received orders for 17 Miura Lamborghini’s] The publicity alone is worth more to me than I’m getting for the car.

<BR>

[Later Dallara finding out that Marisa was a ‘close’ friend of Ferruccio]
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At the 350 GTV debuting at the 1963 Turin motor show and expecting sales volumes at a similar level to tractors] Mr Rambaldi, for the opening day of the show I want 400 to 500 contracts. [Only one contract was actually signed the whole show.]

A good worker in the morning, and a man who likes enjoying himself in the afternoon.  Because I’m not interested in ending up like my colleagues, with heart problems!  
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On which architect he chose to design the golf course he is building] It’s me!  I looked at more than 40 golf courses all over the world, from California to Japan. Now I know how to do it myself.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>

[On his first car] I started motoring soon after the war, with a Fiat Topolino. I went through a large number of them, and soon I began to tune them, taking the displacement up from 500 to 750cc and fitting my own Testa d'Oro head to convert them from side valves to overhead valves.
