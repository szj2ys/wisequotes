I can’t tell you how much fun I’ve had.  It stimulated me, roused my long-held desire to be an architect of ideas. <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>That’s weird.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>This product means more to me than anything I’ve done.  I want you to be the first person outside of Apple to see it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On John Sculley] He’s really smart.  You wouldn’t believe how smart he is.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On John Sculley] I really think you’re the guy.  I want you to come and work with me.  I can learn so much from you.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Even if I have to pay for it out of my own pocket.  We’ll have to solve those problems, because you’re the best person I’ve ever met.  I know you’re perfect for Apple, and Apple deserves the best.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’m sorry I don’t have much furniture.  I just haven’t gotten around to it.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>You’re the only one who will understand.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>We had different ways of looking at the world, different views on people, different values.  I began to realize this a few months after he arrived.  He didn’t learn things very quickly, and the people he wanted to promote were usually bozos.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I know they can do better.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It will destroy everything we stand for.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>You’re not going to like this, but Sculley is insisting that we charge $2,495 for the Mac instead of $1,995.  Don’t worry.  I’m not going to let him get away with it!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Sculley charging $2,495 and not $1,995 for the Mac] It’s the main reason the Macintosh sales slowed and Microsoft got to dominate the market.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>During 1984, Microsoft expects to get half of its revenues from software for the Macintosh.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Will Big Blue dominate the entire computer industry?  The entire information age?  Was George Orwell right about 1984?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>There’s no way we’re slipping!  You guys have been working on this stuff for months now, another couple of weeks isn’t going to make that much of a difference.  You may as well get it over with.  I’m going to ship the code a week from Monday, with your names on it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I want something that will stop people in their tracks.  I want a thunderclap.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Come over and look at this.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>It’s a wonderful ecstatic feeling to create something that puts it back in the pool of human experience and knowledge.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Hey, pick yourselves up off the floor, you’re not done yet!  We need a demo for the intro!  It needs to be done by the weekend, to be ready for the rehearsals.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To John Sculley] I think of you just like Woz and Markkula.  You’re like one of the founders of the company.  They founded the company, but you and I are founding the future.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>This is the most important moment in my entire life.  I’m really nervous.  You’re probably the only person who knows how I feel about this.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’d like to open the meeting, with a twenty-your-old poem by Dylan – that’s Bob Dylan.  ‘The Times They Are a-Changin’<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It is 1958.  IBM passes up a chance to buy a young fledgling company that has invented a new technology call xerography.  Two years later, Xerox was born, and IBM has been kicking themselves ever since.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It is now 1984.  It appears that IBM wants it all.  Apple is perceived to be the only hope to offer IBM a run of its money.  Dealers, after initially welcoming IBM with open arms, now fear an IBM-dominated and – controlled future and are turning back to Apple as the only force who can ensure their future freedom.  IBM wants it all, and is aiming its guns at its last obstacle to industry control, Apple.  Will Big Blue dominate the entire computer industry?  The entire information age?  Was George Orwell right?  Now I’d like to show you Macintosh in person.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We’ve done a lot of talking about Macintosh recently.  But today, for the first time ever, I’d like to let Macintosh speak for itself.  ‘Hello.  I’m Macintosh.  It sure is great to get out of that bag.’<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Bill Gates] Bill is basically unimaginative and has never invented anything, which is why I think he’s more comfortable now in philanthropy than technology.  He just shamelessly ripped off other people’s ideas.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Microsoft] They came out with applications that were terrible.  But they kept at it and they made them better.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>I’m sure ‘in time’ we’ll all be dead.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Get [Bill] Gates down here immediately.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Bill Gates launching Windows] You’re ripping us off!  I trusted you, and now you’re stealing from us!  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[Microsoft] They just ripped us off completely, because [Bill] Gates has no shame.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste, they have absolutely no taste.  I don’t mean that in a small way.  I mean that in a big way, in the sense that they don’t think of original ideas and they don’t bring much culture into their product.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I think he [Mick Jagger] was on drugs.  Either that or he’s brain-damaged.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To the Lisa team on sacking 25% of them] You guys failed.  You’re a B team.  B players.  Too many people here are B or C players, so today we are releasing some of you to have the opportunity to work at our sister companies here in the valley.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It’s too easy, as a team grow, to put up with a few B players, and they then attract a few more B players, and soon you will even have some C players.  The Macintosh experience taught me that A players like to work only with other A players, which means you can’t indulge B players.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The happiest two days for me were when Macintosh shipped and when John Sculley agreed to join Apple.  This has been the greatest year I’ve ever had in my whole life, because I’ve learned so much from John.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’d go out to the factory, and I’d put on a white glove to check for dust.  I’d find it everywhere – on machines, on the tops of the racks, on the floor.  And I’d ask Debi to get it cleaned.  I told her I thought we should be able to eat off the floor of the factory.  Well, this drove Debi up the wall.  She didn’t understand why.  And I couldn’t articulate it back then.  See, I’d been very influenced by what I’d seen in Japan.  Part of what I greatly admired there – and part of what we were lacking in our factory – was a sense of teamwork and discipline.  If we didn’t have the discipline to keep that place spotless, then we weren’t going to have the discipline to keep all these machines running.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-16.html">16<a/> </p><p><BR>
