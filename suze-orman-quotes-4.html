<BR>
Keep what you have and create what you deserve.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Truth creates money, lies destroy it.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Look at what you have, not at what you had.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Do what is right for you before you do what is right for your money.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Invest in the known, before the unknown.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Always remember: Money has no power of its own.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] Every day I talk to people who have been adversely affected by the abrupt end of the economic boom of the 1990s.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Personal financial storms can arrive in every season.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When you ignore what the signs and your own senses are telling you, you are not a victim.  In a sense, you are a volunteer.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Even though people know in their hearts and minds that they should take action, they are paralyzed with fear.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes, nothing other than time, mistakes and experience could have served as your teacher, but when it comes to money, I believe from the bottom of my heart that you do not have to suffer to learn.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can learn today what you need to do now – and may need to do tomorrow…
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Some people prosper when times are challenging, and some people never do, even in good times.  
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Some people endure serious personal financial storms and come out stronger than ever before; others get swept away.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Those who do well in both good times and bad times manage their money from a position of power rather than acting out of hope, anger, regret, or fear.  They know how to take risks, and they know when to take shelter…
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People can tell a lot about you from a first impression… Right or wrong, these first impressions are indelible.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is far easier to make a false first financial impression than a false first personal impression.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You tell the world every day, in minor and profound ways, who you are, financially speaking.  You express this through the clothes you wear, the car you drive, the house you live in, the shopping bags you carry, and dozens of other outward subtle cues.  But are you telling the truth?
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the years I have come to learn that, to one extent or another, most people tend to lie about who they are when it comes to their money.  
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have learned the hard way that financial lies destroy financial lives, and that telling the truth about yourself and your money is the only way to keep what you have and create what you deserve.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>

<BR>
<BR>
Lying to myself almost destroyed me.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I became a stockbroker trainee at Merrill Lynch.  When I arrived at this job I knew how to make a great cheese omelet, but I knew nothing about money and nothing about stocks.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The more depressed I became, the more I spent.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was amazing what happened when I began to live the truth.  I stopped having the desire to give a false financial impression to others and started to show people who I really was.  As soon as I did this, I started to feel better about myself.  I began to feel more powerful, and when I felt more powerful, I had more energy.  When I had more energy, I was able to make more of an effort to create what I wanted…
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A lie is more than just an excuse to avoid doing something you know you need to do.  A lie is also more than an excuse for actually doing something that you know will hurt you or someone else.  A lie actively covers up the truth and robs you of your power.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A lie is also a path, one that leads to destruction.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When it comes to money, almost every hour of every day presents a choice about whether to tell a lie or tell the truth.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Each decision you make with your money puts you at a crossroads between truth and lies.  One road leads to creating what you want, the other to destroying what you have.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most people lie about money.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Do you exaggerate what you have, in order to exaggerate who you are?  If so, I am here to tell you that this exaggeration can lead to the destruction of your own wealth as well as that of your associates and loved ones.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No matter how good any financial situation may look at the moment, if it is not grounded in the truth, the foundation it has been built upon will eventually crumble.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Lies destroy money, and truth creates it.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Lies destroy trust, and the loss of trust results in the loss of power.  And when you are powerless, you make the wrong decisions with your money.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you lie about who you are with your money, you will tend to spend more than you have, buy a house without knowing whether you can afford it, act on impulse rather than rational knowledge, and take tragic actions with your own money that could easily destroy your own financial life.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
All destruction starts with a lie, personal or financial.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Trying to look good to others destroys the good you have.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You must keep watch over your money, for what happens to your money directly affects the quality of your life…
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You usually know when someone is not giving you the information that is best for you.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The absence of fear, which is an even greater blessing than the absence of want…
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Good people everywhere will like you for who you are, not for what you have.
