There’s always been a market for people who pretend to know the future. Listening to today’s forecasters is just as crazy as when the king hired the guy to look at the sheep guts. It happens over and over and over.
<BR><a href="charlie-munger-quotes.html">Charlie Munger<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[A young shareholder asked Charlie how to follow in his footsteps, and Charlie brought down the house by saying.] We get these questions a lot from the enterprising young. It’s a very intelligent question: You look at some old guy who’s rich and you ask, ‘How can I become like you, except faster?’ Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts… slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day – if you live long enough – most people get what they deserve.
<BR><a href="charlie-munger-quotes.html">Charlie Munger<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I always like it when someone attractive to me agrees with me, so I have fond memories of Phil Fisher.
<BR><a href="charlie-munger-quotes.html">Charlie Munger<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
So what makes sense for the investor is different from what makes sense for the [Fund] manager. And, as usual in human affairs, what determines the behaviour are incentives for the decision maker.
<BR><a href="charlie-munger-quotes.html">Charlie Munger<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You have to figure out where you’ve got an edge. And you’ve got to play within your own circle of competence.
<BR><a href="charlie-munger-quotes.html">Charlie Munger<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When Warren lectures at business schools, he says ‘I could improve your ultimate financial welfare by giving you a ticket with only twenty slots in it so that you had twenty punches – representing all the investments that you got to make in a lifetime. And once you’d punched through the card, you couldn’t make any more investments at all. ‘ He says ‘Under those rules, you’d really think carefully about what you did, and you’d be forced to load up what you’d really thought about. So you’d do so much better.’ Again, this is a concept that seems perfectly obvious to me. And to Warren it seems perfectly obvious. But this is one of the very few business classes in the United States where anybody will be saying so. It just isn’t the conventional wisdom. To me it’s obvious that the winner has to bet selectively. It’s been obvious to me since very early in life. I don’t know why it’s not obvious to very many other people.

<BR>
The successful investor is usually an individual who is inherently interested in business problems.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Doing what everyone else is doing at the moment, and therefore what you have an almost irresistible urge to do, if often the wrong thing to do at all.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Practical investors usually learn their problem is finding enough outstanding investments, rather than choosing among too many.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Usually a very long list of securities is not a sign of the brilliant investor, but of one who is unsure of himself.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All the correct reasoning in the world is of no benefit in stock investment unless it is turned into specific action.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The vast majority of stock traders are inevitably doomed to failure.
<BR><a href="benjamin-graham-quotes.html">Benjamin Graham<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.
<BR><a href="benjamin-graham-quotes.html">Benjamin Graham<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are right.
<BR><a href="benjamin-graham-quotes.html">Benjamin Graham<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To achieve satisfactory investment results is easier than most people realise; to achieve superior results is harder than it looks.
<BR><a href="benjamin-graham-quotes.html">Benjamin Graham<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Buying stock in new or virtually new ventures] This we condemn unhesitatingly and with emphasis. The odds are so strongly against the man who buys into these new flotation’s that he might as well throw ¾’s of his money out of the window and keep the rest in the bank.
<BR><a href="benjamin-graham-quotes.html">Benjamin Graham<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
No-one will take as much care with your money as you will yourself.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Investment expertise can never be bought or hired. Anyone possessing such skill will use it on his own behalf for the maximum personal gain, and will not on behalf of a host of ungrateful strangers for a pittance of a salary.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Any experienced investor knows only too well that when it comes to liquidity and interest rates, nothing is carved in stone. That is why, like everything in life, professional investors seek as much certainty as possible and always opt for a long-term fixed interest rate when they borrow, no matter that current forecasting may be projecting future interest rate declines. If the deal works at current rates, then only a fool would place it in the realms of uncertainty by borrowing at floating rates.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Many [property investors] are migrants driven by a hunger to succeed and a self-help attitude deserving of nothing but respect.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>

<BR>
<BR>
Any investor who’s been around the block will confirm that the old adage about banks being fair-weather friends is true. Banks clamour to lend money in good times, but panic when the economy turns southwards.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In short, the golden rule of property investment is to buy quality and never sell.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Rapid wealth from property investment stems primarily from borrowed funds and it follows that anyone capable of organising a property empire is smart enough to do it on his own behalf and not for the benefit of a lot of old lady shareholders.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You should do your own investing and not let others do it for you no matter how small your beginnings. You will make far more money with far less risk.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Property is a money business and when emotion intrudes the money goes right out the window.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In short, I am saying stay away from undeveloped land. It will return you nothing or next to nothing on your capital and cost you rates while you wait for a miracle. If you’re lucky and the miracle occurs, chances are it could happen to coincide with the fortunately rare occasions when the voting public lose their senses and give the Labour Party a crack in office.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Half a century’s experience has taught me that, profit-wise, less is more. In other word’s, do less and think more and in the process make every post a winning post.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Some countries, notably in Asia, allow foreign commercial property ownership only where there is a 50 percent partnership with a local. Every account I’ve heard of where some brave soul has done this has been a tale of distress.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is no great secret in fortune making. All you do is buy cheap and sell dear, act with thrift and shrewdness and be persistent.
<BR><a href="hetty-green-quotes.html">Hetty Green<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I buy when things are low and no one wants them. I keep them until they go up, and people are crazy to get them.
<BR><a href="hetty-green-quotes.html">Hetty Green<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To quote the stock markets – suppose you buy at 16 and are offered 32… Better take the offer, I say; 32 in the hand is worth the whole arithmetic in the bush.
<BR><a href="hetty-green-quotes.html">Hetty Green<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The odds of anyone calling you on the phone with good investment advice are about the same as winning Lotto without buying a ticket.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Reading and studying Graham’s work is how I first became fascinated with the stock market. I still apply his teachings wherever and whenever I can.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On value-oriented strategies] Though these strategies have been well documented over many years, most individual and professional investors do not have the patience to use them.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It might not be today or tomorrow, but if you do your homework well, the stock market will eventually recognise the inherent value that attracted you to the bargain opportunity in the first place. 
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It has never been easier to make a fortune in real estate.
<BR><a href="robert-g-allen-quotes.html">Robert G Allen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
How many millionaires do you know who have become wealthy by investing in savings accounts?
<BR><a href="robert-g-allen-quotes.html">Robert G Allen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Real estate is a wonderful wealth generator but a terrible cashflow generator.
<BR><a href="robert-g-allen-quotes.html">Robert G Allen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On focusing on cashflow] I try to pretend that the property I buy will never appreciate in value.
<BR><a href="robert-g-allen-quotes.html">Robert G Allen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Be such a powerful steward over your forest of money trees that they can produce fruit to feed generations of people long after you have gone.
