<BR>
Happiness comes from small improvements, not by getting somewhere once and for all. Being able to add on one room to your house is what makes you happy, not living in a palace.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Happiness is not an accident. Nor is if something you wish for. Happiness is something you design.

<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
This is the true joy of life-the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one, the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown to the scrap-heap….

The glow of satisfaction which follows the consciousness of doing our level best never comes to a human being from any other experience.

<BR><a href="zig-ziglar-quotes.html">Zig Ziglar<a/>

<BR> 
Happiness is neither virtue nor pleasure nor this thing nor that but simply growth.  We are happy when we are growing.
<BR><B>William Butler Yeats</B>
<BR>
<BR>

Happiness is a by-product.  You cannot pursue it by itself.
<BR><B>Samuel Levenson</B>
<BR>

We are built to conquer environment, solve problems, achieve goals, and we find no real satisfaction or happiness in life without obstacles to conquer and goals to achieve.
<BR><B>Maxwell Maltz</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Happiness requires problems….
<BR><B>H L Hollingworth</B>
<BR>
<BR>
To strive with difficulties, and to conquer them, is the highest human felicity.
<BR><B>Samuel Johnson</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One might think that the money value of an invention constitutes its reward to the man who loves his work.  But, speaking for myself, I can honestly say this is not so….I continue to find my greatest pleasure, and so my reward, in the work that precedes what the world calls success.
<BR><B>Thomas A Edison</B>
<BR>
<BR>
We find greatest joy, not in getting, but in expressing what we are…. Men do not really live for honors or for pay; their gladness is not in the taking and holding, but in the doing, the striving, the building, the living.  It is a higher joy to teach than to be taught.  It is good to get justice, but better to do it; fun to have things but more to make them.  The happy man is he who lives the life of love, not for the honors it may bring, but for the life itself.
<BR><B>R J Baughan</B>
<BR>
<BR>
There is joy in work….There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something.

Happiness consists in activity.  It is a running stream, not a stagnant pool.
<BR><B>John Mason Good</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Happiness is not in having or being; it is in doing.
<BR><B>Lilian Eichler Watson</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The secret of happiness is something to do.
<BR><B>John Burroughs</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The soul’s joy lies in doing.
<BR><B>Percy Bysshe Shelley</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The enjoyment of life would be instantly gone if you removed the possibility of doing something.
<BR><B>Chauncey M. Depew</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Action itself, so long as I am convinced that it is right action, gives me satisfaction.
<BR><B>Jawaharlal Nehru</B>
