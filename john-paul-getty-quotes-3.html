<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The only part of an automobile that cannot be made foolproof by a safety device is the nut that holds the wheel.  By much the same token, there are no safeguards that can protect the emotional investor from himself.

People seem to believe that every millionaire has his millions in ready cash, stored in strongboxes beneath his bed or in a handy wall safe in his library, to hold or squander according to his whim.  They also… believe that money can buy them everything and solve all their money problems.  In the case of a ‘working’ millionaire – a wealthy individual actively engaged in business – nothing could be further from the truth…
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>

<BR>
<BR>
A businessman’s worries over paying off a $5,000,000 bond issue that has matured are no less great, immediate and personal than those of a $75 a week clerk who has to meet a $500 note that’s falling due!
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I can’t remember a single day of vacation in the last 45 years that was not somehow interrupted by a cable, telegram or telephone call that made me tend to business for at least a few hours.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>

<BR>
You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I recall one man who tried to sell me what he said was a rare 16th Century tapestry, and for ‘a mere $45,000.’  When I told him I wasn’t interested, he flew into a rage.  ‘But you’ve got to buy it!’ he shouted, thrusting the tapestry at me.  ‘My wife worked months to make it!’

The Rockefellers began building Rockefeller Center, the largest privately-owned business and entertainment complex in the United States – and possibly the entire world – in 1931, during the depths of the Depression.  Most American businessmen considered the project an insane one…  Nonetheless, the Rockefellers went ahead with their plans and build the great Center.  They reaped large profits from the project – and proved that they were right, and that the majority was dead wrong.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The truly successful businessman is essentially a dissenter, a rebel who is seldom if ever satisfied with the status quo.  He creates his success and wealth by constantly seeking – and often finding – new and better ways to do and make things.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The successful businessman is no narrow specialist.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The architect who designs a breathtakingly beautiful building is often a poor man compared to the tenants who will occupy it.  The engineer who builds a dam may well earn less from his labors than the landowner whose acres are irrigated by water from the dam.  The architect and engineer have created and built; their success is no less great because they did not earn fortunes from their work.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
An occasional crisis is good for a businessman.  There’s not better exercise for him than to have a few messes to clean up every now and then.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
