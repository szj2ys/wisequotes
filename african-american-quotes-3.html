<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Throughout our history, when people have looked for new ways to solve their problems and to uphold the principles of this nation, many times they have turned to political parties. 
<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>

Even in this age of increasingly sophisticated electronic media, spending some quiet time with a book that inspires and uplifts the human spirit remains one of the most fulfilling of life’s pleasures. 
<BR><a href="coretta-scott-king-quotes.html">Coretta Scott King<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
We are laying the foundation to train young leaders… in the tradition of Martin Luther King. When you have enough world leaders who have been exposed this way, it’ll make a difference. 
<BR><a href="coretta-scott-king-quotes.html">Coretta Scott King<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
In these past eight years since my husband’s death not everything was negative. The roots of nonviolent protest had penetrated deeply. When the days of marching, sitting-in, and boycotting had passed, a decisive section of the Movement transformed itself. A new emphasis was given to electoral politics and coalition. Blacks moved into elective posts as mayors of major cities, as state and national legislators and as city councilmen. In May of 1975 there were 3,503 blacks holding elective office. In 1955 there were less than 100. More striking the black electorate became a force so that black concerns were felt in every discussion of legislation. 
<BR><a href="coretta-scott-king-quotes.html">Coretta Scott King<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
New economic opportunities opened, especially in more prosperous periods. Blacks, who only yesterday were predominantly workers of the soil, laborers or house workers are now found in almost every field of gainful employment. In some areas some jobs are tokens, but in the past even tokens were denied. The years of struggle have yielded visible progress in the past eight years, and the martyrdom of Martin Luther King Jr has inspired steps toward a richer life for blacks. 
<BR><a href="coretta-scott-king-quotes.html">Coretta Scott King<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
The experience positive in some many respects, is nevertheless partial and tentative, illustrating once more that the road to freedom is long and winding. An economic recession or depression wipes out far more black than white gains. The economic reserves of a black family or community are far less and the suffering is consequently more intense for blacks. However, even with the fulfilled promise, blacks have achieved a victory of the spirit that had for long eluded them. With the emergence of Martin Luther King [Jr] and the mass movement he inspired they learned that they could attain unity and hold it until they had won a victory. Beyond this they learned that even after mistakes, lost ground can be recaptured. These are lessons which suggest the future will have fewer defeats and more successes. 
<BR><a href="coretta-scott-king-quotes.html">Coretta Scott King<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
If Martin Luther King [Jr] had lived on the, the fight ahead would be easier, but because he did live the fight will take place informed by experience. Ultimately, nonviolence equality, and justice must prevail in a land whose own fight for independence was guided by these principles. 
<BR><a href="coretta-scott-king-quotes.html">Coretta Scott King<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Martin seemed to have the need to get on with his destiny. 
<BR><a href="coretta-scott-king-quotes.html">Coretta Scott King<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
To do something for humanity.

[On building the multi-million dollar Martin Luther King Jr Center in 1980] What I want people to feel when they come here is a presence. I want them to feel that the closest thing to Martin [Luther King Jr] is his presence in this center. Actually, Martin [Luther King Jr] doesn’t need this, but the nation does. 
<BR><a href="coretta-scott-king-quotes.html">Coretta Scott King<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On the Martin Luther King Jr Center not being a mere brick and mortar memorial to the curious tourist.] Our center is about dealing with meeting people’s basic human needs. We want to deal with the totality of the human condition, to transform the individual while we transform the system. 
<BR><a href="coretta-scott-king-quotes.html">Coretta Scott King<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This center [Martin Luther King Jr Center or The King Center] is designed to last 100, 200, maybe 300 years. It’s a monument to truth, justice and peace. 
<BR><a href="coretta-scott-king-quotes.html">Coretta Scott King<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
There was never a question in our minds that we were not doing the most important thing we could be doing for ourselves and for a better society for our children, all children, to grow up in… 
<BR><a href="coretta-scott-king-quotes.html">Coretta Scott King<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I have a dream that one day in Alabama little black boys and black girls will join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Sooner or later, all the people of the world will have to discover a way to live together. 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Nothing pains some people more than having to think. 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I have a dream today! 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
When the history books are written, someone will say there lived black people who had the courage to stand up for their rights. 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
We have learned to fly the air like birds and swim the sea like fish, but we have not learned the simple art of living together as brothers. 
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. 
<BR>
<BR> 
The Gandhian philosophy of nonviolence, is the only logical and moral approach to the solution of the race problem in the United States.
