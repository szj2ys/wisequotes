<BR>
[The New York Post] Editors were worried to change too much of it because they thought it was a great brand and if you did things you’d hear things…
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The first thing to do was to break through… and say the post has to develop, it has to evolve…
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Surprise them… if you just tell them what they heard on the news the night before, they’re not going to buy your paper.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On gossip] I think it’s always been a pull.  Gossip, entertainment and sports are a core part of the New York Posts strengths.  You have to add to that great news and breaking news…
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Gossip, celebrities, entertainment are a key part of what people look for.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We think about the different positions we take.  
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We believe strategically direct television or Echostar would be a fantastic fit with our company. 
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We have a lot of skills in newspapers… I think on eof the problems we had at the post was we weren’t leveraging some of those skills we had overseas.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] We’re the number one newspaper in Australia.  We’re the number one newspaper publisher in England.  I personally see ourselves as very much a newspaper company and I’m proud of the skills we have.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] I would assume 20-25% of our business is from print.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] I wouldn’t rule out acquiring other newspapers if an opportunity arose.  Having said that… the growth in the company will continue to be our television.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think we’re in great businesses.  They’re fun and they’re exciting and if you’re good at them you’re going to take market share away from your competitors.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you manage the businesses well you’re going to improve them and continue to grow your profits.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The Network television model is a challenged model.  Cost of programming continues to increase, ratings are tougher and tougher to achieve.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] I couldn’t think of a better job than to run the New York Post.
I remember as a kid my father flipping through it [The New York Post] and teaching me what was a good headline, what was a good page design.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My father is focussed on the day to day, on running the company.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father Rupert Murdoch in 2003] I don’t think he expects to ever give up the reigns himself.  He’s got so much energy.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Rupert Murdoch] What he does with all his executives is throw them in the deep end and give them great challenges and expect them to achieve in those challenges.  I think that’s what he’s done frankly with all of his children.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s [about] throwing challenges at people and seeing how they do.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Even on vacation work is always turning over in his [Rupert Murdoch’s] head and that’s incredibly admirable and from my point of view it’s great to see that and to learn from it.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
We are very close to our mother.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Rupert Murdoch] He comes at it from a creative point of view, well actually you can do news better.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If we provide a better product and a sharper product you can grow both circulation or the viewership and ultimately the business follows that.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s not looking at problems that are really creative problems and saying lets get some business analysts to look at these and do their numbers.  It’s first coming at it from a creative point of view and saying if we can do this better, is there a market for it?  The second thing is getting fantastic executives…
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his own future if he was doing something else] It’s hard to imagine.  You grow up in a family business and you grow up working 20 hours a day trying to run part of that family business.  It’s very hard to step back from that.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s very hard to say… could you unplug this and plug something else in.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[March 2009 interview] I'm sitting on a fair amount of cash, which is good. But I'm not yet sure it's a good time to invest.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On 2009 being an interesting year for media groups] Because a lot of companies will be pushed close to, if not through, their banking covenants ... so it's a great time to be sitting on the sidelines and watching closely.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I do think Australian newspapers - and this includes [News Corporation rival] Fairfax - have invested in the journalism behind their papers.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It's quite easy to generate transactional revenue from people on mobile phones because people understand that if you use your phone, you will be charged.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We sometimes forget that those we send to report for us from places like
Bali feel the trauma and grief like everyone else.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We forget that those working behind a camera, a recorder or notebook feel the pulse of humanity as we do.  The best of them feel that pulse more strongly.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have reflected often these past days on how we, the Australian media, will
respond to our own tragedy. How will we play our part in serving our own
devastated communities?
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What choices will we make as we step through the various stages of healing
our nation?
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2002] Over the last 25 years, I have been privileged to grow up retaining the love
of good journalism, the craft, while learning its business: the dollars and cents.  I have learnt that they are not mutually exclusive but integrally self-reliant. Each dependent on the other.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The industry is littered with self-styled purists who believe the business of media - the requirement to make a profit - somehow corrupts the craft.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The idea that owners of media organisations regard the practise of journalism as a public service is as outdated as the idea that businesses operate in the interests of a better world…
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I happen to think that serious journalism is about informing the community, reflecting their interests and championing their causes. The size of a newspaper is simply irrelevant.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe narrow-mindedness - disguised as high-mindedness - risks making
its media irrelevant, instead of being as diverse and valuable to as many people as possible.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We all have to expand our capabilities to encompass the changing world, its
growing diversity and, indeed, its complexity.
