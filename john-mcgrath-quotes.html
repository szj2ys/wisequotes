One important [lesson[ one, which I utilise consistently is that to be successful you need to have a dozen balls in the air at one time, because inevitably five or six of them are going to fall to the ground.  Everyone has to expect that kind of failure rate – it’s logical that if you’re always stretching yourself to new levels and challenging the status quo not everything will go to plan.  To be successful and have a great life you need only five or six balls to stay in the air.  You don’t need to have everything work out for you all the time.  What you need is for a few key things to work out for you some of the time.

I try to make sure that the people I spend time with are positive people whom I can learn from; people who can inspire me to greater heights.  Surrounding oneself with positive people is also a type of insurance.  When things go badly, as they do for all of us from time to time, the presence of positive people acts as a safety net.  With positive people around you, you are better able to push onto and over the next hurdle.

[On Harry Triguboff] Harry is an extremely successful businessman.  He came to Australia with nothing and has made himself a Billionaire.  As always I was keen to find out what there was about Harry that made him such a high achiever.  As soon as we sat down at the table I said to his associate, ‘Tell me about Harry.  How come he’s been so successful?’  He replied that in his view Harry’s most important quality was his single-mindedness.  ‘Harry’s most important quality was his single-mindedness.  Harry has a goal and a vision.  He walks into a meeting and he doesn’t want to hear why we can’t do it.  He wants to hear how we can do it.’
