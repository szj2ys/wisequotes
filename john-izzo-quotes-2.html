[On Jackie age 66] ‘I have been a banker for 25 years, but I always wanted to be a teacher.  Business was my fathers passion.’

<BR>
Did this week or day feel like my kind of week/day?  What would make tomorrow/or next week feel more true?
<BR><a href="john-izzo-quotes.html">John Izzo<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Was I the kind of person I want to be this week?  In what way do I want to be more like the kind of person I want to be tomorrow or next week?

Knowing that we will likely regret the things we did not try can have a significant effect on how we make decisions.  Failure it appears is not the regret that haunts most people; it is the choice not to risk failure at all.  In fact, many of those I interviewed told me that what we call ‘mistakes’ often turn out to be the moments of greatest learning.
<BR><a href="john-izzo-quotes.html">John Izzo<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
For fear of rejection, or failure, or because we are not sure we can succeed, we die with our book, our dreams, our story inside us.
<BR><a href="john-izzo-quotes.html">John Izzo<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Whenever I had a risk, I was considering, I would begin by imagining the highest possible good that could occur by taking that risk.  I would imagine all the things that could be true if the risk worked out.  Then I would imagine the worst possible thing that could happen if I took the risk.  I would ask if I could handle the worst thing, and every time I knew I could handle the worst.
<BR><a href="john-izzo-quotes.html">John Izzo<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Though one of the secrets is to leave no regrets, most of us will have a few.  So we must choose to heal the regrets we do have, to bathe them in forgiveness, to know that in most cases we did the best we knew how to do at the time when we acted.  It is a sign of our wisdom that we can embrace regret and let it go.

[On interviewing a 93 year old on their secret of a 52 year marriage] ‘Always treat your partners as an equal.  Whenever you are angry at your partner, ask yourself ‘Is the thing I am angry about more important than our relationship?  Is it worth jeopardising the love we have for each other?
