You only get one Alan Bond in your lifetime and I’ve had mine.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t give guarantees to governments, I get them.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Operations don’t worry me a lot… I’ve had a lot of them and I believe I’m bulletproof.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Thank the f*ck I’m getting your kidney, not your brain.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A very wise old man who taught me about TV once told me if you can be right 60 percent of the time, you’ll own the world.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My father worked bloody hard to survive, and I didn’t see him because he paid a price for success…
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am not evading tax in any way, shape or form.  Of course, I am minimising my tax.  Anybody in this country who does not minimise his tax wants his head read.  I can tell you as a government that you are not spending it so well that we should be donating extra.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Last year I suffered a major heart attack and died.  I didn’t die for long but it was long enough for me.  I didn’t come back to control John Fairfax.  I didn’t come back to break the law.  And I certainly didn’t intentionally come back to testify before a parliamentary inquiry.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
This is not about money, it’s about ego.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I know more about gambling than anyone in this f*cking country.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I take risks for recreation… I don’t take risks with the company.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course I was secretive about it, but I have been secretive about every business deal I’ve ever been in to start with, as has everybody else who has ever done something successful.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1982 on increasing Consolidated Press’s borrowing by $90 million] I have thought we are heading into a depression for the past eighteen months to two years.  But we have all the money we need to ensure that if others go broke, we won’t.  That is what the increase in borrowings is all about.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1982 on whether he had borrowed more money than he needed] Absolutely.  If the international banks do go broke and there’s a depression, not a recession, those merchant banks out there might not have the money.  They are in a far weaker situation then I am.  So I intend to have my money locked up, and can afford to pay the extra half a percent interest.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My father was a gambler.  Every man who ever created anything was a gambler.  I am along, but there’s a difference… I’ve never risked the lot.  I’ve never risked anything that’s going to put Consolidated Press at risk.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ll tell you right from the f*cking start, I’ve never paid the full price for anything in my life.  Now, where’s the quote?
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Right, I’ve written a figure here.  If you can get underneath it, you can have the business.  If not, you can forget it.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve been to the other side, and let me tell you, son, there’s f*cking nothing there.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My grandfather went to the races and somebody dropped ten bob… he put I on a horse and it won at twelve to one.  He bought a ticket for Sydney and went into the newspaper industry and did quite well.  That was where my family started from, ten bob on a racecourse.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is a little bit of whore in all of us, gentlemen, don’t you think?

<BR>
You British reckon everything can be solved by compromise and diplomacy.  We Australians fight to the very last ditch.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being asked in 1979 who he most admired] I really hold no one in higher regard than my father. [Frank Packer]
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1979 on his father] So what was my father?  What were my feelings towards him?  I was a bit scared of him.  He was a strong man.  He was a just man.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had a disrupted childhood, which was nobody’s fault.  It wasn’t a matter of neglect, it was a matter of circumstance.  My father worked bloody hard to survive, and I didn’t see him because he paid a price for success…
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I didn’t really see much of my mother or father until I left school.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was wartime of course and hard to get into a school, so I went to a girl’s school with my aunty’s daughters.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I got a lot of beltings, because I wasn’t a very good child, but in all the times I can remember that I got a belting from him I never got one I didn’t deserve, and there were quite a few I didn’t get that I should have got.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On an economics textbook at school] How can you be bothered reading this boring sh*t.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On learning the family business] The old bastard has sent me out here and says I’ve got to spend two weeks on every job in this place.  It’s going to take me a year, and I’m starting with you.  You’re my boss.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was having a very torrid love affair with a very beautiful lady from overseas.  I was working from seven o’clock in the morning till three in the afternoon, and she was working till eight o’clock, she was a mannequin.  And by the time I was getting home which was about four o’clock in the morning the hours of sleep has been contracted to a point where they were almost non-existent…
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On their Telegraph newspapers] It’s not worth a cracker, this place.  It loses money all the time, we’d do better to sell the thing and rent out the building.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father selling the Telegraph to Rupert Murdoch] Emotionally it tore him to shreds.  But he stood back from it as a businessman and said, ‘It’s a good deal.  If I want this company which I have built to continue to prosper and grow, it’s a deal I should make.’
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father in 1979] I think he was a very great man.  There are people who create things… perhaps fifty or a hundred in every generation.  I’m not one of those.  He was.  I’m very proud of him.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1979] My father always said, ‘Son, by the time you get to thirty-five, thirty-six years of age they won’t let you into any bloody clubs, so join early.  You’re going to be treading on too many corns and there’ll be too many people who don’t like you at that stage.  You’ll never get elected.’  So he put us down for a whole series of clubs when we were eighteen or twenty years of age, so we got in before anyone didn’t like us too much.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Basically, when I meet people, I don’t expect to like them…
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
At the end of the day you’ll either sign a contract or you won’t sign.  And then you’ll walk out of here.  If you don’t sign I’ll tell Channel Ten that we’ve had discussions and they’ve got nowhere.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being told by a lawyer that it wasn’t fair for his client] Don’t you f*cking tell me what’s fair and what’s not fair.  I should be down at the Open now, and instead I’m here talking about making money for your f*cking client.  Now do you want to talk or don’t you?  
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
F*ck it, he’s going.
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We’re all harlots, how much do you want?
<BR><a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the formation of the World Series Cricket] Why not get the world’s best cricketers to play the best Australians?
