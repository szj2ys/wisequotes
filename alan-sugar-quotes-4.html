But never buy more than you would normally buy just for the sake of it.

<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
On the one hand, if a high profile person is so stupid to place themselves in a compromising position, one could argue: why should the courts protect them?  On the other hand, does being famous means that you should have less privacy than other people?
