[In 1998] I would think that if you went and spoke to the people we did our deals with, 99 percent of them, or maybe 100 percent would think they were treated very well, that it was fair, that we kept our word, and they would do another deal with us.  And I think that if you don’t leave that kind of impression, the next deal is not going to be there.

Ownership gets employees to think like owners, to think the company is really theirs.  Really good ideas and innovative ideas come from the bottom of organizations, where people are dealing directly with customers… People can see the silly things the chairman may be doing that is wasting a lot of money, and there might be a better way to do it.  We encourage people to think that way.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>

I wasn’t charged with any wrongdoing… Still, the crisis had taken its toll.  The weeks of seeing my reputation – my most important asset – dragged through the mud worse me down and hurt deeply.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As the chairman and CEO of Citigroup – the largest financial institution in the world – I had been thrown into the ensuing maelstrom by those seeking scapegoats for the losses experienced by countless investors.

<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I always worried about my business and never felt I could ease up on thinking about potential risks.  Indeed, I had many sleepless nights, some of which I even spent at the office.  My team understood the special importance I placed on surfacing problems early.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I… limited the risk to our company’s balance sheet and preferred to take operational risk rather than assume too much financial leverage… Never betting the balance sheet, we could live with the consequences of an occasional operational mistake.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>

To this day, I can manipulate numbers in my head with ease.

[On getting married] Despite the tussle with my dad earlier that year, Joanie’s father told us he’d be willing to spend $5,000 on our wedding and gift and gave us the option on how the sum should be split.
