In Russia, they used to have pogroms against the Jews.  They’d cut up the pregnant women and take out the kids.  They’d tear up their fathers and then have a dance in the main market.  I was six years old when I found out about that.  I said, ‘I’m going to America when I grow up.’

Why I took away the beds and the refrigerator?  The whole house, an empty house?  I told them, they were so nice to me I can’t stand it not to keep my promised.  [That night she took a couple of mattresses from the store for the family to sleep on.] The next day I brought in a refrigerator and stove, and the kids quit crying.
<BR><a href="rose-blumkin-quotes.html">Rose Blumkin<a/>
<BR>

[On being taken to court by a carpet manufacturer who was trying to get them to charge a minimum price when she was selling it at half the standard price and sent three lawyers to court when she showed up to court alone.] I say to the judge, ‘I don’t have any money for a lawyer because nobody would sell to me.  Judge, I sell everything ten percent above cost, what’s wrong?  I don’t rob my customers.

<BR><a href="rose-blumkin-quotes.html">Rose Blumkin<a/>

[On having problems paying suppliers during the war due to the market being suppressed.] I don’t know what I’m going to do.  I can’t eat the merchandise.
<BR><a href="rose-blumkin-quotes.html">Rose Blumkin<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On hiring the Omaha City Auditorium to make a big sale when she was worried about how to repay a $50,000 90 day loan.] This is It!  The Sale of Sales!  Shortages?  Malarky!  We can’t eat ‘em!  We must sell ‘em!  We’ve been shipped so much merchandise this past 60 days, we have no warehouse room.  Yes, we’re overloaded, and how!  We can’t eat ‘em and usually couldn’t sell as much in six months.  So we’ve staged the largest sale ever of its type ever held in this area… 45,000 square feet filled with the most unheard of savings of famous brand merchandise.  [She sold $250,000 worth of furniture in three days.] From that day, I never owed anybody a penny.

<BR>
<BR>
[On the half day that she doesn’t work (Sunday afternoons.) travelling with her son Louie driving around town looking at competitors.] I go shop the windows.  I plan an attack on the shopkeepers, thinking, ‘How much hell can I give them?’ 
<BR><a href="rose-blumkin-quotes.html">Rose Blumkin<a/>
<BR>
