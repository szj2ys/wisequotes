I woke up one day, the stock went through the roof, and the market valuation of the company I think hit four billion dollars.  And I said ‘Oh my God.’  I could take one billion of that, set it aside and make this vision come true.
<BR><a href="patrick-soon-shiong-quotes.html">Patrick Soon Shiong<a/>

It could be so much easier just to go and play golf, (which I don’t) or play basketball everyday which I could… I love playing basketball.  But it’s almost like now it’s even worse, because I feel almost like there’s a responsibility now.  I’m so blessed, because this country has given me so much and there’s a sense of purpose.  Everybody has a sense of purpose.  So I feel very much a moral obligation, a personal obligation to do what I do.

[On decision to carefully tag the source of it’s raw material (300,000 pigs) for Heparin rather than just using any available supply.] It was a moral and ethical obligation to do that… If we had not made that decision in 2005 in 2007 this country would not have had a safe supplier of Heparin.
<BR><a href="patrick-soon-shiong-quotes.html">Patrick Soon Shiong<a/>
<BR>

So rather than starve the tumor, what if we fed the tumor what it actually is using from your human body to feed and grow but feed it with an anabolic drug and create a Trojan horse and kill it?

<BR>
<BR>
The only way a doctors get reimbursed is to treat you when you’re sick.  There’s no reimbursement to the doctor if I keep you out of the hospital, keep you at home, keep you healthy.  There’s no healthy code.

[With this wife Michele Chan] Growing up in South Africa during the time of apartheid, we had direct experience of inequality, including great disparities in health and access to good care.  After thirty years living in the United States, we see similar disparities in health care on our doorstep in Los Angeles, and across the nation.
