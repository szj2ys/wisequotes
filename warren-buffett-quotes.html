Excellent investment opportunities come about when superior businesses experience a one time event that depresses the stock price in relation to it’s intrinsic value.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>The future is never clear.  You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.  Uncertainty is the friend of the buyer of long-term values.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Price is what you pay, value is what you get.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>We don’t get paid for activity, we get paid for being right.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>I never attempt to make money on the stock market.  I buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years.  As far as you are concerned, the stock market does not exist.  Ignore it.  Much success can be attributed to inactivity.  Most investors cannot resist the temptation to constantly buy and sell.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Buy so well, you don’t have to sell.  Don’t buy for 10 minutes.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>We like to buy businesses; we don’t like to sell them.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>We think diversification, as practiced generally, makes very little sense for anyone who knows what they are doing.  Diversification serves as protection against ignorance.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>We don’t get into things we don’t understand.  We buy very few things, but we buy very big positions.  Know what you own, own a few and buy a lot.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>It is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR> [Over] time, you will find only a few companies that meet these standards.  So when you see one that qualifies, you should buy a meaningful amount of stock.  You must also resist the temptation to stray from your guidelines.  If you aren’t willing to own a stock for ten years, don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR> [Boat with a leak] Instead of great managers trying to fix the leak and spending all of their time bailing water, they may be better advised to find another boat.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>I don’t try to jump over seven-foot bars; I just look around for one-foot bars that I can step over.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>The dumbest reason in the world to buy a stock is because it is going up.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Managers of the Berkshire subsidiaries are worth, on average $100 million.  They all love what they are doing.  Otherwise, they would retire, since they are no longer working for money.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>The way to wealth is as plain as the road to the supermarket.  It depends on two words, industry and frugality.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>In the short run, the market is a voting machine.  In the long run, it’s a weighing machine.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Praise by name, criticise by category.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Be content with moderate gains.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>[Warren on money] It could make me independent.  Then I could do what I wanted to do with my life.  And the biggest thing I wanted to do was work for myself.  I didn’t want other people directing me.  The idea of doing what I wanted to do everyday was important to me.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>One lesson is not to overly fixate on what you have paid for a stock, the second is not to rush unthinkingly and grab a small profit.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>The key is having more information than the other guy – then analysing it right and using it rationally.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>A stock might be the right to own a piece of a business, and the intrinsic value of the stock was something you could estimate, but with a margin of safety, you can sleep at night.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>I learned that it pays to hang around with people better than you are, because you will float upward a little bit.  And if you hang around with people that behave worse than you, pretty soon you’ll start sliding down the pole.  It just works that way.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>We diversify substantially less than most investment operations.  We might invest up to 40% of our net worth in a single security under conditions coupling an extremely high probability that our facts and our reasoning are correct with a very low probability that anything could drastically change the underlying value of the investment.    <BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>I am likely to limit myself to things which are reasonably easy, safe, profitable and pleasant.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>The dominant retailer in one twenty-year period is not necessarily the dominant retailer in the next.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Time is the friend of the wonderful business, the enemy of the mediocre.  You might think this principle is obvious, but I had to learn it the hard way… It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.  Charlie understood this early; I was a slow learner.  But now, when buying companies or common stocks, we look for first-class businesses accompanied by first class managements.  That leads right into a related lesson: Good jockeys will do well on good horses but not on broken down nags.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Tom Murphy started by managing a bankrupt TV station in Albany so frugally that he painted only the sides of the building that faced the road.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Writing a cheque separates conviction from conversation.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>You don’t have to think of everything, you know.  It was Isaac Newton who said I’ve seen a little more of the world than others because I stand on the shoulders of giants.  There’s nothing wrong with standing on other people’s shoulders.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Regardless of price, we have no interest in all in selling any good businesses that Berkshire owns, and are very reluctant to sell sub-par businesses – even if that hurts performance – as long as we expect them to generate at least some cash and as long as we feel good about their managers and labour relations.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>If you are going to drive 10,000 pound trucks across a bridge repeatedly, it is well to build one that can withstand 15,000 pound loads rather than one that can withstand 10,000 pounds… It is a big mistake to have lots of financial obligations and no cash reserve… Personally I have never used more than 25% borrowed money in my life, including when I had only $10,000 and had ideas that made me wish I had $1,000,000.00.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>It takes a lifetime to build a reputation and a five minutes to ruin it.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>If someone goes through life and measure themselves solely by how much they have, or how much money they earned last year, sooner or later they’re going to end up in trouble.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Bill Gates Sr [Senior] posed the question to the table: ‘What factor did people feel was the most important in getting to where they’d gotten in life?  And I said ‘Focus’, and Bill [Bill Gates Jr –Junior] said the same thing.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Rule number 1: don’t lose money.  Rule number 2: don’t forget rule number one.  Rule number 3: don’t go into debt.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>You can’t do well investing unless you think independently.  And the truth is, you are neither right nor wrong because people agree with you.  You’re right because your facts and reasoning are right.  In the end, that’s what counts.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="warren-buffett-quotes-2.html">2<a/></p><p><BR>
