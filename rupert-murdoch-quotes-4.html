<BR>
<BR>
I’m paranoid enough to see an agenda every day.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s very hard.  Everything is a bit subjective.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On how we select our stories] There is no doubt… who’s side we’re on and who we think is good and who we think is evil.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Not using the word terrorist shows bias.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We are not neutral when it comes to war.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Ted Turner] I still have a soft spot for him.  He was a visionary, he did have the guts to start CNN.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We had to hurry up before anyone else did the same thing.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his toughest competition] I’ve had many in my life.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The newspaper wars in Sydney really blooded me for ten years.  
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In Britain there was tremendous competition everywhere, but in the early days when I was there you only had to get to work 8 or 9 hours a day five days a week and you were doing twice as much as your competitors.  I shouldn’t have said that.  But it’s true.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We’ve had rough times.  My biggest competitor in Britain in a sense were the unions.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We were the first company in the private sector in Britain in 50 years to have a big fight with the unions.  And to take them on and win.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Britain strike] It was amazing that no one was killed… We had to have barbed wire fencing put in around us.  1200 police… 300 on horseback…
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On initially coming to the US being the toughest challenge there] We came here with very few resources.  We were much smaller, a much smaller company.  The tough thing was starting from nothing.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Starting the Fox Network took longer than it should have, or that we want it to, or expected it to.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We were pretty short of money…
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was very hard as a new comer.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On John Malone] I think he is the most brilliant financial mind – as a financial engineer… He’s a shrewd investor.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On talking about someone having sold a business wanting it back] He won’t want it back.  He’d have to go to work to run it!
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve been pretty much a loner.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2001] We’re a pretty tight family.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being a loner] I think my father taught me that.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When you’re in the media business you don’t want to be a joiner of clubs.  You don’t want to put yourself in a position where you can be subjected to any sort of pressure about what you’re publishing, what you’re saying publicly.  You should do what you think is right.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You have to resist all… forms of pressure…
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s right to be somewhat of a loner – to keep your distance.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the idea of being a politician in an opposition party] What can you really do there?
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think you can do great good in the media and you can do it everyday.  And you can also have the thrill of being involved.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I know I’m thought to be ruthless.  I can be.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The buck stops with you.  If you newspaper starts to go bad or lose a lot of money, loses it’s place or it’s respect in the community – your editor doesn’t get blamed – you get blamed.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Comment in 2001 on betting the ranch] Oh sure.  Several times.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[Comment in 2001] I bet the ranch when I came out of Adelaide and went to Sydney.  I bet the ranch when we bought into London… with the old News of the Word which was a dead old company at the time.  I didn’t realise that I just thought it was an opportunity to get over there.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Comment in 2001] Bet the ranch with the London Sun.  Certainly bet the ranch with the Times and the biggest bet was the fight with the unions.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Dealing with the bureaucracy of General Motors, in an old company like that – things take a long time.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The world is full of opportunities.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Keep our powder dry.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] I think it’s very early days yet in the internet.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] People laughed at me when I bought Myspace.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Myspace] Viacom was going to do a deal the next day and we made the lawyers work all weekend.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Myspace] Someone else didn’t appreciate it.  We had no idea it was going to grow so fast.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] I hope it’s a golden era.  It is certainly one with golden opportunities.
