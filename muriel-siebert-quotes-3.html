[On her mother having to have one leg amputated after turning gangrenous whilst being a smoker] Everybody on Wall Street smoked, but I stopped cold turnkey the day I saw my mother on the surgical gurney.

<BR>
<BR>
You’re going to have to excuse my language, but I called him a f*cking liar to his face.
<BR><a href="muriel-siebert-quotes.html">Muriel Siebert<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m still flattered when I’m called a girl.  I guess this sounds awfully flip, even for 1977, but in those nascent days of what came to be called feminism, there was so much stridency, so much rhetoric, so many disagreeable leaders… But that was then.
<BR><a href="muriel-siebert-quotes.html">Muriel Siebert<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In the mid-1980s, Wall Street was dominated by people like Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken and other corporate raiders, whose leviathan deals were have a negative effect on the small investor.

<BR>
When things are going well, you have to reappraise and prepare for growth by training people to whom you can delegate.

<BR>
<BR>
I have great faith in the technological creativity of this country.

<BR>
We’ll be able to look back ten years from now and view today’s financial events merely as an unfortunate episode of history.

<BR>
I expect truth and I expect those numbers to show.

[In September 2012] The world is global today and the markets are global today.
<BR><a href="muriel-siebert-quotes.html">Muriel Siebert<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On blue chips such as Pfizer in September 2012] You know that in five years, you can make a lot of money.  You don’t buy those stocks to trade them.  You don’t buy them because you think they’re going to go up in two months time, you buy them because they’re going to find another acquisition…

This world is the only world I know.  To me it’s represented a constant challenge.  I’ve seen things I’ve wanted to do and I’ve done them.  In some cases being a woman was an obstacle, but it probably gave me more incentives that I would have had if I’d been a man… I don’t think ahead.  I don’t know what I want to do next, whenever I do it.  I don’t know what other possibilities there are.  I wasn’t looking for the superintendent job, it came along.  There was no guarantee I’d do a good job.  I think I’ve squeaked through.  You don’t have guarantees in this world.  You’ve got to take chances.

I was a partner of a small firm, Finkel and Company, because I could not get hired by a large firm and get credit on the business.  They did not have women.  We just were not there.  They had women as secretaries; sometimes they had an analyst or two; but we were secretaries.  This was a period of time that was not nice on Wall Street.  I remember, I wanted to change jobs because the men were being paid twice what I was being paid.  And I had changed jobs twice.

Only in America could my story take place.

<BR>
When I started out on Wall Street, there were no women there other than the secretaries…

<BR>
<BR>
On the job, I had to be flexible and learn to speak two different languages.  To fit in on the trading desk, where every third word was a four-letter word, I had to talk like the guys, but for my clients, institutional portfolio managers, I was the complete opposite: analytical, thoughtful, and proper.
<BR><a href="muriel-siebert-quotes.html">Muriel Siebert<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Being a woman also helped me because it was so unusual at that time – I was unique.

Besides making money, I wanted my career to be about ‘How can I used my talents and abilities, and make a difference?’  In 1975, on the first day members of the New York Stock Exchange could discount commissions, Muriel Sierbert & Co., In., opened as a discount brokerage firm and later became the only woman-owned NYSE brokerage firm with a national presence.
