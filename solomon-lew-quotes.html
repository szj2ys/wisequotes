<BR>
Good retailers are not defined when times are good.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Cycles – good times and bad times – are an inevitable part of retail life.  It is our business to manage according to the times.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
At its core, retail is a very simple proposition – to know your customer and provide the products that they want, at the time they want it, and at a price they are prepared to pay.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The best time to buy is when the market is soft.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2008] There is not much rationality in the share market at this time.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1983 after purchasing 10 percent of Myer Emporium] This acquisition is a long-term investment and the fulfilment of a lifelong ambition to hold a significant stake in Australia’s premier departmental store organization.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I saw my Dad die at 45… He never got to enjoy life and I don’t want to make the same mistake.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his three Rolls-Royces in 1989] Not for show.  You live once and why not enjoy your money?
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am a principled man.  But if someone crosses us in a deal, I have a long memory!
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On not being re-elected to the Coles Myer board in November 2002] It seems that I will not be re-elected largely due to the opposition of people who do not have their own money invested in the company…
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] A bit of inflation can’t hurt.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Why should the government miss out on collecting two and a half billion dollars worth of tax at a minimum…?
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2008] No business is immune but some are better placed than others.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2008] We are living through extraordinary times…
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2008] In my forty-five years in business, I have never seen anything like the challenging times we confront today.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
During downturns opportunities arise.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2009] In Australia we have been both lucky – due to our extraordinary endowment of raw materials and China’s continued strong demand through the crisis – and we have also made our own luck.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Good retailers are not defined when times are good. In retail the test of a good
retailer is to deliver a credible result in a difficult retail environment.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2010] The reserve bank should be conscious of giving the people a go.     
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The mining boom is something totally separate to the general economy.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
[On online sales in November 2010] A billion dollars a month, is going offshore.  Now that billion dollars a month, is doing nothing for Australia.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On overseas online sales in November 2010] There’s a real fear that this business could grow and it’ll hurt the Australian economy overall.  It’s just not retail.  
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is a massive amount of goods that are coming into Australia, that are not being charged GST and not paying any duty.  That is a very unfair disadvantage to the major players in the industry.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2010] We’ve got well in excess of one thousand stores, we are a collector – seven days a week, every minute of the day, of GST on behalf of the government.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Australian government and online overseas sales in November 2010] It’s very simple.  They have to collect duty and GST at the point of entry.  
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On listening to former United States President Bill Clinton briefing 60 businessmen, each paying $18,000 a head] It was like history in the making, absolutely inspiring.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1995] The Yannon transaction was arranged in 1990 by two former Directors. It was a transaction of a different era for the company. A transaction like Yannon would not be contemplated today. We are committed to dealing with these issues and we are dealing with them as openly, honestly and quickly as possible.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2002 on Coles Myer needing more directors with retail experience] That seems perfectly logical.  In fact it seems so obvious you’re probably wondering why I am saying it.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2002] While it seems that I will not be re-elected largely due to the opposition of people who do not have their own money invested in the company, please be certain that I will continue to pursue the effort that Coles Myer reaches its full potential and promote reform.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We are not in business for the current environment, we are in business for the long term.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Probably the best time to buy is when the market is soft.  Because then you are not overpaying, you are taking advantage of other people’s possible misfortunes.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2008] We have plenty of cash, we are totally unleveraged, no debt at all…  Therefore, you know, $300 million could turn into a billion takeover.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2008 on purchasing the Just Group] We think we paid fair value, we are happy with the business…
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2008] You have to remember as well that the Just shareholders, a lot of them came on to the Premier register by accepting Premier shares, and they are now going to reap the benefits going forward.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The Just Group are fortunate to have people like the Premier board owning that business today.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You have to go with the market.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2008] By cutting the GST by 50 percent and taking it down to 5 percent, you immediately inject money into all industries… The GST cut will accelerate demand and keep employment up.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2008] We are living through extraordinary times as we witness the continuing unfolding of the financial crisis and the consequences for both the equity markets and the real economy.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In April 2007] None of us would ever underestimate the most successful Australian politician of our age, John Howard.
<BR><a href="solomon-lew-quotes.html">Solomon Lew<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I can tell you from my own experience that numbers go up and down.  But when they are down they can move up very quickly.
