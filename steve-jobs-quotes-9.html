I am but 30 and want still to contribute and achieve.  After what we have accomplished together, I would wish our parting to be both amicable and dignified.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I haven’t got any sort of odd chip on my shoulder.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>These people all called me.  They were thinking of leaving the company.  Apple has a way of neglecting people.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>What I’m best at doing is finding a group of talented people and making things with them.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’ll always remember Apple like any man remembers the first woman he’s fallen in love with.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>When someone calls you a thief in public, you have to respond.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It’s hard to think that a $2 billion company with 4,300 employees couldn’t compete with six people in blue jeans.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Paul Rand] There was a clarity in our relationship.  He had a purity as an artist, but he was astute at solving business problems.  He had a tough exterior, and had perfected the image of a curmudgeon, but he was a teddy bear inside.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I spoke with Hartmut Esslinger this weekend and he suggested I write you a note expressing why I wish to work with him and frogdesign on the new products for NeXT.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>These [organizational] charts are bullsh*t.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Really, really great job on this.

You will be ahead of the parade.  It’s never been done before.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Part of my responsibility is to be a yardstick of quality.  Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>If we do that, the world isn’t standing still, the technology window passes us by, and all the work we’ve done we have to throw down the toilet.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I think we have to drive a stake in the ground somewhere, and I think if we miss this window, then our credibility starts to erode.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The honeymoon is over.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>‘What happened?’ Ross Perot asked.  I sold him a computer.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To Bill Gates about NeXT] We did the Mac together.  How did that work for you?  Very well.  Now, we’re going to do this together and this is going to be great.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To IBM Chairman John Akers] I couldn’t resist telling him I thought IBM was taking a giant gamble betting its entire software strategy on Microsoft, because I didn’t think its software was very good.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To IBM on wanting a simple contract but receiving a 125 page one] You don’t get it. <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>It’s great to be back.  [An event] that occurs only once or twice in a decade – a time when a new architecture is rolled out that is going to change the face of computing.  What we realized was that higher ed wants a personal mainframe.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I hope you get a chance to look at this a little later.  It’s the most beautiful printed circuit board I’ve ever seen in my life.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>He, this is Steve, sending a message on a pretty historic day.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Two years ago we made a decision.  We saw some new technology and we made a decision to risk our company.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>What we’ve done is made the first real digital books.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>There has not been an advancement in the state of the art of printed book technology since Gutenberg.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>A word that’s sometimes used to describe me is ‘mercurial’.  Of or relating to, or born under the planet Mercury.  I think the third one is the one they mean: ‘Characterized by unpredictable changeableness of mood.’  If we scroll down the thesaurus, though, we see that the antonym is ‘saturnine.’  Well what’s that?  By simply double-clicking on it, we immediately look that up in the dictionary, and here it is: ‘Cold and steady in moods.  Slow to act or change.  Of a gloomy or surly disposition.’  Well I don’t think ‘mercurial’ is so bad after all.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We’re going to be charging higher education a single price of $6,500.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Early next year, we will have our 0,9 release, which is for software developers and aggressive end users.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>It’s not late.  It’s five years ahead of its time.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On the Lucasfilm computer division which would become Pixar] I was blown away, and I came back and tried to convince Sculley to buy it for Apple.  But the folks running Apple weren’t interested, and they were busy kicking me out anyway.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Pixar] I wanted to buy it because I was really into computer graphics.  I realized they were way ahead of others in combining art and technology, which is what I’ve always been interested in.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Silicon Valley folks don’t really respect Hollywood creative types, and the Hollywood folks think that tech folks are people you hire and never have to meet.  Pixar was one place where both cultures were respected.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>My view is that people are creative animals and will figure out clever new ways to use tools that the investor never imagined.  I thought that would happen with the Pixar computer, just as it did with the Mac.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Oh, wow!  I really get this, I get what it’s all about.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I have many faults, but one of them is not ingratitude.  Therefore, I have changed my position 180 degrees – we will freely help.  Thanks for the clearer perspective.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I believed in what John [Lasseter] was doing.  It was art.  He cared, and I cared.  I always said yes.  All I ask of you, John is to make it great.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On buying Pixar] Life kind of snookered me into doing that, and perhaps it was for the better.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Joan Baez] I wasn’t expecting a lot, but she was really smart and funny.  It turned into a serious relationship between two accidental friends who become lovers.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-16.html">16<a/> </p><p><BR>
