<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’d make every woman who stopped to look.  I would show her that a three-minute makeup could change her life.

<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On naming her new perfume and on receiving samples some of friends and associates said it was ‘beautiful’] That’s good enough for me, we’ll call it Beautiful.  I’m so tired of all those sexy names that are being used to sell perfume.  If you’re beautiful, you’re also going to be sexy – you just don’t have to talk about it.
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
[To Neiman Marcus saleswomen] Every one of you can be an Estée Lauder.  You’re beautiful.  No matter how old you are, you can always feel like a bride.  Now I am going to show you my new commercial.  It’s going to be on television through the world!

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On not greeting a customer with the customer ‘May I help you?’ but instead] I have something that would look perfect on you, madam.  May I show you how to apply it?
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her first public appearance] On a little black and white container.
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On selling in Saks - I] resolved to break the rules that sheltered this traditional and exclusive store from experimental merchandisers who would sell their souls to sell from Saks.
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To Stanley Marcus about distributing her products in Neiman Marcus] I’m Estée Lauder and I have the most wonderful beauty products in the world and they must be in your store… [The very next day the products were in the store with her stopping everyone who came into the store and saying] Try this.  I’m Estée Lauder and these are the most wonderful beauty products in the world.  
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[‘One year my mother was away twenty-five weeks.’ – Leonard Lauder] We travelled from Dallas to Seattle, from Chicago to San Francisco.  The length and breadth of the country.   
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was unstoppable, so great was my faith in what I sold.  
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
[On marketing her fragrance – ‘Youth Dew’ not as a perfume but as bath oil] Because it was feminine, all-American, very girl-next-door to take baths.  [A woman could buy herself a bottle of bath oil the way she would buy a lipstick] Without feeling guilty, without waiting for her birthday, anniversary, graduation, without giving tiresome hints to her husband.
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Our competition used many models to speak for them.  We decided to personify our products in the vision of one woman – the same model.
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On choosing in 1971 Karen Graham to be only the third model to present the brand]  A young sophisticated woman with charm and éclat.  She was sensual rather than sexy.  She was strong and smart.  She seemed in charge of his life, which was perceived as the good life by millions of women who identified with her and strove to be like her.
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The Estée Lauder woman was more formal, more involved in dressed-up elegance.  [Now she has achieved] A more relaxed richness that reflects today’s world.  She’s become less status-conscious.  Our Estée Lauder woman is within reach.  
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Business doesn’t have a sex.
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>

<BR>
I have never worked a day in my life without selling. If I believe in something, I sell it, and I sell it hard.
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There's no secret. Why are all brides beautiful? Because on their wedding day they care about how they look. There are no ugly women — only women who don't care or who don't believe they're attractive.
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you have a goal, if you want to be successful, if you really want to do it and become another Estée Lauder, you've got to work hard, you've got to stick to it and you've got to believe in what you're doing.
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her husband Joseph] I met him in the country club in Peekskill, New York, where my father had a country home.  Joe was playing golf.  He was much older than me, but to this day he says it was love at first sight for him.  He’s still a very handsome man, don’t you think, and the eldest of our two sons, Leonard, looks just like him.
<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="estee-lauder-quotes.html">Estee Lauder<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Viennese women always wear hats and so do I. It's a habit I inherited from my mother. Hats are like a picture frame for your face. Even at night I like to wear a veil or a tiny cap on the back of my head.
