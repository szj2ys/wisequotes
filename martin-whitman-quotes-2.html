<BR>
<BR>
[In Sept 2000 on the Nasdaq despite it’s recent plunge.] Fantastically overpriced – I’ve lived through a lot of speculative bubbles, but never one this big.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The one thing I hate about mutual fund business is that you don’t control the cash flows.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In Sept 2000 on CRO’s – Contract research organizations that help drug manufacturers test new products.] In some cases you can buy these things for under book value and less than ten times depressed earnings.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course I’m different.  I know I’m different.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you had told me seven years ago I would be so heavily involved as a value investor in small-cap high-tech plays, I would have said forget about it.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Wall Street spends too much time.] Making predictions about unpredictable things.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his celebrity title as a ‘Vulture Investor’] It’s a lot better than being called an indexer or an asset allocator.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Lots of these guys were quite smart.  Even though they didn’t need the cash at that time, when the market was terrific, they took advantage of the opportunity to raise a lot of money.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When you’re in well-capitalized companies, if they do start to dissipate, you get a chance to get out.  On the other hand, when you’re in poorly capitalized companies, you better watch the quarterly reports very closely.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve held securities for three years and sold them for a double only to see them triple over the subsequent six months.  [Moral] Just sitting around is a better way to make money.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I couldn’t be a trader.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On value investing.] It’s the art of the possible.  The aim is not to maximize profits, but to be consistent at low risk.  I never mind leaving something on the table.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Wall Street] It was ridiculous.  Ninety-eight percent of the emphasis was on short-term earnings and the near-term outlook.  
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Preparation, preparation, preparation.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I did what I wanted to do.  I showed Wall Street and the academicians, all those efficient market guys, that they don’t know what they’re doing.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On junk bonds after the crash.] There are huge profit potentials in owning junk.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A bargain that stays a bargain isn’t a bargain.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Part of the process of becoming an intelligent passive investor is to understand not only the general financial environment but also who the other participants in the investment process are…
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In value investing, the goal is to determine a business’s worth and its possible or probable dynamics, all independent of the price at which the common stock issued by that business trades.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Value investing is different from other kinds of investing.  It is wholly unrelated to technical and chartist analyses.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
If future earnings or cash flows do not create wealth, then those earnings were fictitious to begin with.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In value investing, the essential goal is to value a business or the workout potential for credits issued by troubled companies.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In value investing, macrofactors such as the level of stock averages (eg The Dow-Jones Industrials), forecasts of interest rates, or the gross domestic product (GDP) are ignored.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In value investing, corporate analysis is viewed as something separate and distinct from market analysis.  In other disciplines, corporate analysis and market analysis are almost always integrated with each other.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In value investing, the analyst is extremely price conscious in making judgments about the attractiveness of a security.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
On Wall Street, value investing seems very much to be a minority approach restricted to investors trafficking in corporate control; but on Main Street, where most businesses are privately owned, it appears to be the majority approach.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Value investing… revolves around obtaining a fairly deep understanding of either the business, the securities issued by that business, or both.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Value is a dynamic concept.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Because every investment has something wrong, the trick is certainly not to find perfect investments but to arrive at judgments that not enough is wrong to dissuade investing.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Equity investing always involves trade-offs.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In value investing, the investor does not gauge timing but rather takes advantage of whatever the market situation happens to be at that time.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Nothing happens in the financial community that does not entail huge transaction costs for clients, whether those clients are retail, institutional, or corporate.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Any attempts to predict markets, to predict near-term securities prices, or to measure market results consistently (i.e., all the time) is speculation, not investment.  On Wall Street, such people are called investors; in value investing, they are speculators.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Value investing just does not work for people deeply involved in trying to predict near-term stock prices or general trends for securities markets or commodities markets.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Good past market performance may mean a dearth of good present investments.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On purchasing shares based on practical valuation techniques.] Think Main Street not Wall Street.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In the safe and cheap approach, little or no use is made of esoteric derivatives.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The most attractive value investments are in the common stocks of extremely well financed companies, which sell at material discounts from readily ascertainable net asset values.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Diversification is only a surrogate, and usually a damn poor surrogate, for knowledge, control, and price consciousness.
<BR><a href="martin-whitman-quotes.html">Martin Whitman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Different market participants have different rationalities.  What is rational for safe and cheap investors (e.g., ignore near-term market swings) would be utterly irrational for heavily margined day traders who know little or nothing about the securities they buy and sell, and vice versa.
