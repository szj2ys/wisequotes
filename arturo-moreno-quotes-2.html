<BR>
[In 2004 on saying he didn’t specifically target Hispanic players.] Absolutely coincidental.  We targeted more than those players.  We looked at the whole menu.

<BR>
<BR>
No 1. pride point.  Nobody is happier than when I’m down in Mexico on a beach with a beer.  I love my heritage.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
First thing is, I’m an American.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If anybody went to Vietnam and told you they weren’t scared, those are the ones you have to worry about.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the owner of the store he had to work in whilst he was getting his marketing degree.] He looked to see if our hair was cut, our shoes were shined and if we had a tie on.  It was about how we serviced clients and the customer is always right.  I tried to carry that on.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[When he was one of the owners of the Salt Lake City Trappers from 1985-1992] I had more fun than anyone should be allowed to have.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Our differences were more business-related.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2005 on The Dodgers versus the Anaheim Angels] We’re starting to get a nice little market rivalry.  I think it’s a real exciting time for baseball in Southern California.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On making the name Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim from Anaheim Angels.] You know, I pretty much live life smiling about things.  It’s baseball, you know?
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When you take a risk, you’re either thinking you’re real smart or you’re real dumb.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2005] If you’re going to niche market, you’re going to get trapped.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We’re not trying to sell a city.  We’re selling Angels baseball, period.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2005 on new sponsorship deals such as the one with Verizon.] I can’t say Verizon is buying us now because we changed the name.  Verizon is buying us because we’re putting a winning product on the field.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
All our broadcast partners come out of L.A.  Plus, when I go to New York and turn the Angels on the TV, it will be New York/Los Angeles, large market vs. large market, and over time that brand grows.  
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2005] Many speak of reaching the World Series.  I just want to win one.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m a fourth-generation American.  I think of myself as an American.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have four brothers and six sisters, so it was a busy household.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his mother] She was a very bright lady.  My mom was really the manager of the house, while my dad was working.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My brothers and I shared a room.  We spent a lot of time together playing sports, talking, wishing, and dreaming.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We did not have a television when I was very young, so we would sit around on my mom’s bed and listen to the radio.  I think I was eight or nine before we got our first TV – back when there were only a couple of stations!

<BR>
I probably started establishing my goals when I was in the army.  Out of high school I went to college, but I didn’t do very well.  I ended up getting drafted and spent two years in the army.  One of those years I was deployed in Vietnam, and I spent a lot of time thinking about where I was going to go to school when I returned.  I knew I could use the GI Bill to pay for it.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My dad was a high school dropout, so his goal was to make sure we all finished high school.  I remember in high school wondering how I was going to get to college.  I was certainly no Einstein.  Even today, I consider graduating from college perhaps my greatest personal success.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One of my goals in college was to work for a corporation, to become a ‘corporate guy.’  Part of my motivation was status: You work for a good corporation and with luck you get paid well and receive all the benefits.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I attended the University of Arizona, and I received a good education.  I was an accounting major before switching to marketing.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have a son who’s getting ready to go to college.  I tell him, ‘You social experience in college is going to stay with you just as long as your educational experience.  The socialization you get going to school is just as valuable as what you learn in the books.’
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I went to work for Gannett, the newspaper chain.  Al Neuharth, the chairman and CEO, was a very, very positive influence in the company.  I loved the way he operated the business.  Listening to Neuharth make a presentation was motivating.  It was very powerful to see how he had planned and structured the company’s future.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I got a management position in the company; I made good money…. I was very happy… As I moved up the ladder, though, there were fewer and fewer management positions.  
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had to decide whether I was going to stay with Gannett or leave and go on my own.  I would say that decision was probably the largest professional risk I ever faced.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On leaving his management position with Gannett] I remember talking to a young lady at a cocktail party around that time.  She told me – to my face – that by giving up my job at Gannett, I had committed career suicide.  I just smiled and said, ‘Your call.’  Ironically, I ended up buying a company that her husband was working for.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I learned early on that if you just look at business simply and logically, you can become successful.  It’s addition and subtraction: If your expenses are greater than your revenues, you lose money.  If you can add and subtract, you’re very dangerous.  Also, you don’t need a real high intellectual level to push forward and compete – to say, ‘Here’s the goal, and we’re getting there.’
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
There is one principle I’ve adhered to for a long time, and it’s something that’s helped me achieve what I have throughout my career: I’m not too afraid of being told ‘no’.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most people go through life afraid to try to accomplish something because they’re afraid someone will tell them ‘no’ or they’re going to fail.  A teenager in high school doesn’t walk across the dance floor to ask a young lady to dance, because if she says ‘no,’ that walk back to his friends looks like a football field.  So he doesn’t even try.  The same thing happens in business all the time.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It takes a combination of things to be successful.  The number one thing is discipline.  Obviously, you have to maintain focus.  You have to set a goal, and then you have to be focused and disciplined.  I tell people to put their goals on paper, because if you keep them in your head, they’re like little Ping-Pong balls bouncing around.  You can’t keep them all in focus.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I bought the Angels, I drew up a seven-year plan.  We bought this company from Disney, and I spent a lot of time studying how they’d been running the business.  I ended up getting hold of a training tape from Disney.  The Disney people know that some people save their whole lives to go to Disneyland.  They did a very good job training their employees to understand they were in a service business.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Service has probably been the number one key to my success – or I should say, our buisness’s success.  It’s the level of service that matters most to me.  If you tell someone you’re going to be there at ten o’clock, you’re there at ten o’clock.  If I can’t be there at ten o’clock, I need to let you know and apologize for not being there.  
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I evaluate things from the perspective of a family and what satisfies them.  Many times I’ve used input from my wife, Carole, and the kids when making certain business decisions.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We try to make the experience as affordable as possible.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Friday nights we always have fireworks.  If we lose a game, it’s tough for me to sit there because I’m mad that we lost the game.  But then here come the fireworks, and everyone is still in the stadium cheering for the fireworks.
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I always laugh at these football players dancing around the end zone.  I prefer the attitude of someone like Warren Buffett – the easy smile, the nice Midwestern confidence.  I like the idea that the richest guy in the world can still walk out of a building carrying his own briefcase, smiling, saying, ‘Have a good day.’
<BR><a href="arturo-moreno-quotes.html">Arturo Moreno<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On inviting some of the original Angels and oldtimers to dinner and being humble when he said.] You guys laid in this place a history, a tradition and a foundation that we don’t want to ever lose again.  I want you, although you’re not on the field anymore, to be a part of this.
