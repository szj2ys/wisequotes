Being positive, and having the right attitude, is probably one of the most difficult of the principles of building wealth, but it plays a huge part in determining how high you will travel up the ladder of success.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t allow negative thoughts to undermined all your well-intentioned plans.  If you listen to negative people around you, you’ll become one of them – one of the 95% of the population who fail to achieve the wealth they’re capable of.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We take more time to plan what we’re going to do with our money when we’re dead than while we’re alive.  It pays to plan if you really want to be financially free.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The mind is a powerful force and visualisation can help turn goals into a reality.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t simply decide to do it – do it.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
1st boy: We are so poor that my Dad owes the bank $2,000.00.  2nd boy: We are so rich that my Dad owes the bank $2,000,000.00.

<BR>
Knowledge takes the worry out of investing… Ultimately, you must become your own expert.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you don’t take some risk with you money, however slight, you’ll run the risk of having to live on the bread line later in life.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Banks have a habit of lending you lots of money when you don’t need it, and nothing when you do.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In a nutshell, I believe that median-priced residential property is the best vehicle for building wealth for the average investor.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like the perfect child, the perfect property does not exist.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Property investment and building wealth are all about dollars and cents, not colours of curtains.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Providing you finish up with a bunch of properties that allows you to retire on the rent, it doesn’t really matter how you get there.  There is no right or wrong property; there are only different ones.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It takes a great deal of commitment, not luck, to stick to a plan and buy property when no one else is.  In ten years time you too will look back and marvel at how cheap property is right now.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Building wealth is achieved through borrowing, buying and keeping residential property for the long term.  It requires time – not timing.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Investing in property for the long term can be dead boring.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There are many who want to invest in property but just can’t get started.  They attend every seminar and read all the books, and believe property to be the best investment – but they just can’t take that first step.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I wasn’t particularly bright or gifted, I always tried to do my best.  It wasn’t that I wanted to be a doctor or anything else, I just wanted to do the best I could because then I believed that something would come my way.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Our real estate career started with a lot of mistakes… And despite all the mistakes, we did buy more properties!
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As far as wealth is concerned, I think it’s important to be totally independent of government.  Only then can you enjoy life to its fullest, but we have very simple needs.

<BR>
Self discovery is something you cannot buy.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her best move] Saving, and buying our first house, and then hanging onto it.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her worst mistake] Renovating!  You have to know what you like and are good at, and do it.  Avoid what you’re not.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have always believe that the best source of information on property investment is other property investors.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can’t rely on the advice of the bank manager who just handles the money, nor the accountant who does the sums and keeps score, nor the solicitor who ensures you keep to the rules.  You should be seeking the advice of experienced, successful property investors.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Buy income-producing residential investment property that is appropriately financed to achieve maximum tax benefits while you are still working.  As property values, rents, and wages increase with time, continue to purchase property by refinancing so that your liabilities (your borrowings or debt) increase with your assets.  At retirement, reduce your liabilities by selling a property or two, or by gradually winding down your loans.  This ultimately should provide you with a retirement package of residential properties that should continue to grow in value and produce a regular indexed income.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have always believe that as individuals, we are fully responsible for our own destiny in life.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The government does not have enough money to look after people in a manner they would like.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Buying an investment property is always better financially than buying your own home, purely because of the tax benefits.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
All successful people have dreams.  If you want to be successful in any aspect of your life, including your financial future, you too must dream and then set goals to fulfil those dreams.  Otherwise there is no motivation to achieve anything beyond where you sit today.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why would you live in a caravan and have fifty investment properties?  Where is the happy medium?  Only you can decide.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The majority of the population retire on an average income of $8,300 per year.  If you want to be one of them, listen to what they say.  If you don’t, stand by your dreams or they may be stolen.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Saving for that first deposit is perhaps the hardest, but it is the most important step in building wealth through investment property.  For it is then that the saving and spending habits become firmly part of a way of life.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is never too late to start investing and it is never too late to start buying property.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The learning path is often long and tedious… but it is rich with rewards.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The right kind of debt can speed up your quest for wealth.  The wrong kind can send you broke.  It’s really as simple as that.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A loan is a commitment.  It is a commitment to your future.  It forces you to put aside money that would in most cases be frittered away – consumed in one form or another – with nothing to show all the hard work over many years.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Your earnings will always equal your expenses… Everyone has to set spending priorities, and investments have to come near the top of the list, not the bottom.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s funny how banks love to give you money when you don’t need it, but never want to give you any when you do.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Hindsight only makes us wiser, not wealthier.
