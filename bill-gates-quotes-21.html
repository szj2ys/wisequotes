<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Pilots like to say that good landings are the result of good approaches.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies struggling with too many unproductive meetings and too much paper don’t lack energy and brains.  The data they need exists somewhere in the company in some form.  They just can’t readily put their hands on it.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Middle managers need as much business data as senior executives but often have less.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Sales needs to quickly find out whether the company has the inventory or can get it quickly before promising delivery on a big order.  Manufacturing needs to know what product is selling like gangbusters so that it can shift production priorities.  Business mangers throughout the company need to know about both and a whole lot more.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
How do you develop a marketing program that doesn’t call for hiring dozens of people and spending tens of millions of dollars?  You begin by putting the information you have to work.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The discussion was straight math…
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

[In 1999] Today, instead of scheduling a general Microsoft strategy tour in eight cities where overall revenue is low, we can determine whether one city needs a seminar on Office, another a seminar on Windows, and a third a seminar on Exchange.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Really difficult business problems always have many aspects.  Often a major decision depends on an impromptu search for one or two key pieces of auxiliary information and a quick, ad hoc analysis of several possible scenarios.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1999] If you’re a district manager at Microsoft today, you must be more than a good sales leader helping your team close the big deals… Now you can be a business thinker.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s business at the speed of thought.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1999] Businesspeople need to shake loose of the notion that information is hard to get.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1999] The paperless office, like artificial intelligence, is one of those ‘any day now’ phenomena that somehow never seem to actually arrive.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1999] Paper consumption has continued to double every four years, and 95 percent of all information in the United States remains on paper, compared with just 1 percent stored electronically.  Paperwork is increasing faster than digital technology can eliminate it!  
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Paper consumption was only a symptom of a bigger problem… administrative processes that were too complicated and time-intensive.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I exercised the privilege of my job and banned all unnecessary forms.  In place of all that paper, systems grew up that were far more accurate and far easier to work with and that empowered our people to do more interesting work.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Putting responsibility into the hands of those affected.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We’ve put responsibility directly into the hands of the people most motivated to act.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Human Resources wants to do ‘thinking work, not manual work.’
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1999] Until we get a breakthrough in flat-screen technology… books and magazines still can’t be beat for readability and portability.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
