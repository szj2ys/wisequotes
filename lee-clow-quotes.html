Most ideas are a bit scary, and if an idea isn’t scary, it’s not an idea at all.

<BR>
<BR>
I'd rather apologize than to be so timid as to not to try and do anything smart or brave.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I found my own way of doing things.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Listen real hard to the smartest guy in the room before you go trying to prove how smart you are.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Creative people are 50% ego and 50% insecurity.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What I’ve always loved to do is build a brand that’s so cool that you want to wear their T-shirt.  
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] People’s relationship with a brand is becoming a dialog, not a monolog.  
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you think you have a better mousetrap or car, or shirt, or whatever, you’ve got to tell people…
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Good advertising is a dialog with people…
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The smartest advertising is the advertising that communicates the best and respects the consumer’s intelligence.  
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
An incredible advertising career is not about creating an incredibly amazing ad, it’s about making an incredible amazing ad every single day of your career, it’s about getting those adds killed, and resurrecting them over and over again.  It’s about your season average not that occasional home-run.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
This industry has created ideas that are as valuable to brands as some of the products they create.  We get paid like we’re doing our clients laundry.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Telling stories on behalf of brands is what I’ve done all my life.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Throughout history, the technology always comes first.  It’s just technology for a while, until the day we artists inherit it.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s very demeaning that we have to put on a show to prove that we know how to put on a show.  
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When creatively passionate people get together to start a company, the energy and camaraderie is really pretty stimulating.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>

<BR>
[On Leeclowsbeard] One day I was in the office and someone said to me, ‘Hey Lee, I loved your tweet this morning on Lee Clow’s Beard.’  That was weird.  Because I don’t tweet.  And what does my beard have to do with it?
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Leeclowsbeard] I mostly like the thoughts in the tweets, I just didn’t tweet them.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Leeclowsbeard] While I may not have technically tweeted these tweets, I certainly believe they are truisms.  In fact, I’ve approved them coming from my beard.  Jason told me at lunch that he had to make a choice when he started his daily observations.  You could have been reading this advertising wisdom from ‘Jeff Goodby’s Ponytail.’
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have always felt the word ‘advertising’ is either a diminutive or derogatory term that kind of goes with stuff people don’t like, and I always felt frustrated because I felt like I was a communication artist or a media artist.  The best advertising is one of the art forms of our culture.

We had to reach back and find the soul of the company once again.

[In 2004 on being at TBWA Chiat Day for 30 years.] Different people are different in terms of the way they’re made.  I knew since the day I arrived at Chiat Day that I was at home, and that I was at a place where I could prove my talent and my ability… I am also married for 35 years too, so it could just be how I am.

The only reason you should move to a new job is if you are not getting the opportunity to do what you want to do and what you believe you can do.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Ultimately, if you are doing great work, the money will come.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>

This business… has a lot more to do with persistence, perseverance and endurance than brilliance.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you are always trying to do something great and different and fresh, lots of them are going to be shut down for lots of stupid or good reasons, but you have to keep on trying.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When they kill one, you have to go and try to make another one.  If you do enough eventually a few of them will make it through the gauntlet.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s all a matter of keeping on doing it over and over again…
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What I know how to do is nurture and help people discover the best opportunities…
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>

<BR>
Most people who are deemed ‘mean’ are usually perfectionist who make mediocre people unhappy, cause they put more pressure on them then they can handle.

<BR>
Steve [Jobs] is unique.  There aren’t many clients that are like that.  You have one guy that you really work for.  That’s very rare.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A thing that most creatives don’t do well is that you’ve gotta learn to listen.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The best way to get a relationship is to listen like hell to what they’re saying.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2004] That’s how I got a relationship with Steve Jobs.  Because I listened really hard to him cause he’s the smartest guy I ever worked for…
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Advertising can be a very frustrating business.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You have to be daring and make something that doesn’t look like anybody else.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>

[In 2011 on Steve Jobs] He was the most amazing person I have ever know.  He was a genius.  He was an innovator.  He was the best client we ever had.  He was my friend.
<BR><a href="lee-clow-quotes.html">Lee Clow<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2011] What Steve Jobs did was simply make everything and everyone better.

<BR>
When you open an Apple product it’s like a religious experience.

Everything a brand does is advertising.
