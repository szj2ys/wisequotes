Don't wish for less problems; wish for more skills. Don't wish for less challenges; wish for more wisdom.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You must either modify your dreams or magnify your skills.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You can cut down a tree with a hammer, but it takes about 30 days. If you trade the hammer for an axe, you can cut it down in about 30 minutes. The difference between 30 days and 30 minutes is skill.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The key to life is to become skillful enough to be able to do rewarding things.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Learn to hide your need and show your skill.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Most people are just trying to get through the day. Sophisticated people learn how to get from the day.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Sophistication is understanding the difference between trinkets and treasures.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't spend major money on minor things. In the last ten years the guy has bought two tons of donuts and only two books - and the books are filled primarily with pictures.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Sophisticated people don't leave early. The man says, "Yeah, but I want to beat the traffic." Isn't that a great skill to have - beating the traffic!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It doesn't take a million dollars to learn the difference between a bottle of fine wine and a Pepsi. Sophistication is a study, not an amount.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>One of the early signs of sophistication is not giving way to all inclinations but rather sending your emotions to school so they will learn how to behave.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Money doesn't make you sophisticated. Only study and practice make you sophisticated. Even people of modest means can become sophisticated because it is within study and practice. How much is a night out at the symphony? About thirty dollars. You say, "Poor people can't afford thirty dollars to go to the symphony." Yes, they can. It's only thirty Hershey bars!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We must teach our children not to spend their money a dollar at a time. If you spend your money a dollar at a time, you'll wind up with trinkets instead of treasures. You can't buy much of value a dollar at a time.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You must get good at one of two things: sowing in the spring or begging in the fall.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>God has the tough end of the deal. What if instead of planting the seed you had to make the tree? That would keep you up late at night, trying to figure that one out.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Plant, don't chant.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>One of my good friends always says, "Things don't just happen; things happen just."<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The soil says, "Don't bring me your need, bring me your seed."<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>How much should you earn? As much as you possibly can. It doesn't matter whether you earn $10,000 a year or $1,000,000 a year as long as you've done the best you can.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The man says, "If I had a fortune, Td take good care of it. But I only have a paycheck and I don't know where it all goes." Wouldn't you love to have him running your company?<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>If you wish to have power and influence over the many, be faithful (disciplined) when there is just a few. If you have a few employees, a few distributors, a few people, that's the time to stay in touch and be totally absorbed - when there is just a few.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Start from wherever you are and with whatever you've got.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Be a student of the fine, not just the mundane and the ordinary that sustains our lives. We all need to be students of refinement, not just existence.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Always be eager to learn, no matter how successful you might already be. In the Millionaires' Club, we sometimes invite a billionaire to come talk to us. He says, "You're doing okay, but come on. How about if you really poured it on!"<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Be a student, not a follower. Don't just go do what someone says. Take interest in what someone says, then debate it, ponder it, and consider it from all angles.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't read a book and be a follower; read a book and be a student.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Success is not so much what we have as it is what we are.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Success is 20% skills and 80% strategy.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Success lies in the opposite direction of the normal pull.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Success is the study of the obvious.  Everyone should take Obvious 1 and Obvious 2 in school.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Average people look for ways of getting away with it; successful people look for ways of getting on with it.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Time is our most valuable asset, yet we tend to waste it, kill it, and spend it rather than invest it.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We can no more afford to spend major time on minor things than we can to spend minor time on major things.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Never begin the day until it is finished on paper.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Learn how to say no. Don't let your mouth overload your back.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Time is the best kept secret of the rich.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Something will master and something will serve. Either you run the day or the day runs you; either you run the business or the business runs you.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Learn how to separate the majors and the minors. A lot of people don't do well simply because they major in minor things.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't mistake movement for achievement. It's easy to get faked out by being busy. The question is: Busy doing what?<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-16.html">16<a/>  </p><p><BR>
