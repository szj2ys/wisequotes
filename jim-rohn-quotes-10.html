Don't waste your time wondering why; spend your time discovering who.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Lead the way by personal example and by personal philosophy.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Leaders must not be naive. I used to say, "Liars shouldn't lie." What a sad waste of words that is! I found out liars are supposed to lie. That's why we call them liars - they lie! What else would you expect them to do?<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Managers help people to see themselves as they are.  Leaders help people to see themselves better than they are.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>When dealing with people, I generally take the obvious approach. When someone says, "This always happens to me and that always happens to me. Why do these things always happen to me?" I simply say, "Beats me. I don't know. All I know is that those kinds of things seem to happen to people like you."<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We could all use a little coaching. When you're playing the game, it's hard to think of everything.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Lifestyle is the art of discovering ways to live uniquely.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Let others lead small lives, but not you. Let others argue over small things, but not you. Let others cry over small hurts, but not you. Let others leave their future in someone else's hands, but not you.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Some people have learned to earn well but they haven't learned to live well.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Lifestyle is not an amount; it's a practice.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Earn as much money as you possibly can and as quickly as you can. The sooner you get money out of the way, the sooner you will be able to get to the rest of your problems in style.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>One of the reasons why many people don't have what they want is neglect.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We've all heard the expression, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away." Well, I've got a good question for you: What if it's true? Wouldn't that be easy to do - to eat an apple a day ? Here's the problem: It's also easy not to do.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Neglect starts out as an infection then becomes a disease.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Cardiovascular problems alone in America create over a thousand funerals a day...and 90% of the problem is neglect.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>There is no greater leadership challenge than parenting.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you talk to your children, you can help them to keep their lives together. If you talk to them skillfully, you can help them to build future dreams.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Leadership is the great challenge of the '90s in science, politics, education, and industry. But the greatest challenge in leadership is parenting. We need to do more than just get our enterprises ready for the challenges of the twenty-first century. We also need to get our children ready for the challenges of the twenty-first century.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Some people are careful with their customers and careless with their children.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It takes time to build a corporate work of art. It takes time to build a life. And it takes time to develop and grow. So give yourself your enterprise, and your family the time they deserve and the time they require.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Americans are incredibly impatient. Someone once said that the shortest period of time in America is the time between when the light turns green and when you hear the first horn honk.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The twin killers of success are impatience and greed.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>How long should you try? Until.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Some people plant in the spring and leave in the summer. If you've signed up for a season, see it through. You don't have to stay forever, but at least stay until you see it through.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>As the day goes by, we choose to do whatever we think is valuable.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Whether the decisions we are making will lead us toward inevitable success or unavoidable failure depends on the information we have gathered over the years to form our personal philosophy.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>How quickly and responsibly we react to adversity is far more important than the adversity itself.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Those who do not learn from the mistakes of the past are condemned to repeat-them.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The key is to find unique humans beings whose personalities and achievements stimulate, fascinate and inspire us, and then strive to assimilate their best qualities.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Great projects are always built from a pattern or blueprint.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Often the most extraordinary opportunities are hidden among the seemingly insignificant events of life.  If we do not pay attention to these events, we can easily miss the opportunities.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We must first master the art of listening before our spoken words will have any great value to others.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The important question is this: In the last ninety days, with this treasure of information that could change our lives, our fortunes, our relationships, our health our children and our careers for the better, how many books have we read?<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>How do we explain the fact that only 3% of our entire national population possess a library card – a card that would give us access to all of the answers to success and happiness we could ever want?<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Reading is essential for those who seek to rise above the ordinary.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The habit of reading is a major stepping stone in the development of a sound philosophical foundation.  It is one of the fundamentals required for the attainment of success and happiness.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>A life worth living is a life worth documenting.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It is the small disciplines that lead to great accomplishments.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Neither success or failure occurs in a single cataclysmic event.  Both are the result of the accumulation of seemingly small and insignificant decisions whose collective weight over the period of a lifetime presents the individual with his or her proportionate reward.  That is why each of us must make a commitment to develop our full human potential, one discipline at a time, one book at a time, and one small entry in our journal at a time.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Only by actively pursuing new knowledge can we sufficiently refine our personal philosophy and change not only our own lives but also the lives of those around us.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-16.html">16<a/>  </p><p><BR>
