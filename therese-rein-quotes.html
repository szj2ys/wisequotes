<BR><a href="therese-rein-quotes.html">Therese Rein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think people don't want sometimes for people to try and fail. I think people don't necessarily want people to have go in case they'll be disappointed because living with someone's disappointment is a very hard thing. So I think they were trying to protect him from disappointment.
<BR><a href="therese-rein-quotes.html">Therese Rein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The first thing I learned I think from him, implicitly, was that to find your field of fascination, to find the thing that you find really intriguing. And to put your energy into that because that creates its own energy.
<BR><a href="therese-rein-quotes.html">Therese Rein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
And the second thing I think is something that I actually heard Sir Phillip Craven say at the recent 20th anniversary of the Paralympics in Bonn, and that is that, what Paralympians do - and my dad was a Paralympian. What Paralympians do is they don't focus on what doesn't work, they focus on making what does work, work to the max. And that's what my dad did. And I think I've learnt a little bit about how to do that from him.
<BR><a href="therese-rein-quotes.html">Therese Rein<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="therese-rein-quotes.html">Therese Rein<a/>

<BR><a href="therese-rein-quotes.html">Therese Rein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On selling off the Australian part of Ingeus in 2007] It was my decision… It was the right thing to do.  It would have been impossible to have a significant government contract in this position.
<BR><a href="therese-rein-quotes.html">Therese Rein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is a whole myth about super people. That super people can do everything and they do it on their own.
<BR><a href="therese-rein-quotes.html">Therese Rein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
