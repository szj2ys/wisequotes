It’s nice to build a successful hotel.  It’s a lot better to build a hotel attached to a huge casino…
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Protect the downside and the upside will take care of itself.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People think I’m a gambler.  I’ve never gambled in my life.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A gambler is someone who plays slot machines.  I prefer to own slot machines.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you go for a home run on every pitch, you’re also going to strike out a lot.  I try never to leave myself too exposed, even if it means sometimes settling for a triple, a double, or even, on rare occasions, a single.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I never get too attached to one deal or one approach…
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I keep a lot of balls in the air, because most deals fall out, no matter how promising they seem at first… Once I’ve made a deal, I always come up with at least a half dozen approaches to making it work, because anything can happen, even to the best-laid plans.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Leverage: don’t make deals without it.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The most misunderstood concept of all real estate is that the key to success is location, location, location.  Usually, that’s said by people who don’t know what they’re talking about.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You don’t necessarily need the best location.  What you need is the best deal.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Location… has a lot to do with fashion.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What you should never do is pay too much, even if that means walking away from a very good site.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can have the most wonderful product in the world, but if people don’t know about it, it’s not going to be worth much.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do… People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can’t con people, at least not for long.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you don’t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As poorly qualified as he was for the job, Jimmy Carter had the nerve, the guts, the balls, to ask for something extraordinary.  That ability above all helped him get elected president.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The dollar always talks in the end.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I never threw money around.  I learned from my father that every penny counts, because before too long your pennies turn into dollars.  
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To this day, if I feel a contractor is overcharging me, I’ll pick up the phone, even if it’s only for $5,000 or $10,000, and I’ll complain.  People say to me, ‘What are you bothering for, over a few bucks?’  My answer is that the day I can’t pick up the telephone and make a twenty-five cent call to save $10,000 is the day I’m going to close up shop.

<BR>
You can dream great dreams, but they’ll never amount to much if you can’t turn them into reality at a reasonable cost.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Life is very fragile and success doesn’t change that.  If anything, success makes it more fragile.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score.  The real excitement is playing the game.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Get in, get it done, get it done right, and get out.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Almost from the time I could walk, I’d been going to construction sites with my father.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You made it in my father’s business – rent-controlled and rent-stabilized buildings – by being very tough and very relentless.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To this day, the Trump buildings in Queens and Brooklyn are considered among the best reasonably priced places to live in New York.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You never stand in front of someone’s door when you knock.  Instead you stand by the wall and reach over to knock… ‘In this business,’ he said ‘if you knock on the wrong apartment at the wrong time, you’re liable to get shot.’
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You used red brick, no necessarily because you liked it, but because it was a penny a brick cheaper than tan brick.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My mother loves splendor and magnificence, while my father, who is very down to earth, gets excited by competence and efficiency.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I can always tell a loser when I see someone with a car for sale that is filthy dirty.  It’s so easy to make it look better.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Well maintained real estate is always going to be worth a lot more than poorly maintained real estate.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Irving was sixty-five years old and a real character.  He was one of the greatest bullsh*t artists I’ve ever met, but in addition to being a very sharp talker and a very slick salesman, he was also an amazing manager.  Irving was the kind of guy who worked perhaps an hour a day and accomplished more in that hour than most managers did in twelve hours.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It never pays to be in too much of a hurry.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was remarkable in a way: the seller paying for the costs of the potential buyer.  Still, you have to put it into perspective.  What sounds like a stupid deal today was very different at a time when no one wanted to build anything, and the city was dying.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The city was on the verge of bankruptcy, but what I saw was a superb location.  Unless the city literally died, millions of affluent people were going to keep passing by this location every day.  The problem was the hotel, not the neighborhood.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The city is in trouble, but it’s still a great city, and it’s our city, and if you don’t believe in it, if you won’t invest in it, how can you expect to turn it around?  If you lend millions of dollars to Third World countries and suburban-shopping-mall magnates, don’t you also owe some obligation to your own city?
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There are some people in your life you just want to pay your respects to, no matter what it involves.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I want to build the most fantastic building in New York.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was a great-looking design, but it was also very saleable.  To hit a real home run, you need both.
