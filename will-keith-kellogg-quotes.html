<BR><a href="will-keith-kellogg-quotes.html">Will Keith Kellogg<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1894] I found it impossible to meet the expenses of the growing family with the rather meager income and had acquired considerable indebtedness.  About 1893 or 1894, Dr J. H. (John Harvey Kellogg) told me that if I could succeed in finding some agents to sell his subscription books, he would give me 25 percent of the net profits on sales made on any I might secure.  Although at the time I was working fifteen or more hours a day, I was fortunate in securing the services of several first-class book men, with the result that at the end of thirteen and one-half years, I was free from debt and felt very happy to have my last mortgage paid.

<BR>
<BR>
First I answered all inquiries concerning rates.  Then I saw to it that Dr Kellogg answered the purely medical inquiries.  I was indirectly responsible for the Good Health Publishing Company as well as for Modern Medicine Publishing Company and Sanitas Food.  I was a member of the labor committee and chairman of the committee in charge of the Sanitarium Food Company.  I acted as unofficial credit manager and also was in charge of the issuing of cards and making prices for all operations.  I was responsible for investigating and issuing cards to charity patients and was always called on in cases of death to go with friends and relatives to the undertaker and to assist in the selection of a casket.  I was always notified when insane patients succeeded in getting away.  I was so overloaded with work that I am conscious that very little, if any of it, was performed satisfactorily.

<BR>
<BR>
Someday I’ll be in a position to help people to help themselves.
<BR><a href="will-keith-kellogg-quotes.html">Will Keith Kellogg<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When the Sanitarium Board voted to make me business manager (during the absence of Dr. Kellogg) and to print my name on the letterhead, I declined the offer.

[In 1898] I purchased forty acres of land on the bank of Mill Lake twelve miles west and north of Battle Creek, for $800, making a down payment of $100.  From then until about 1906 the family lived at the place in the summers, and I would go there for a day on each weekend.
