[On being told if no-one takes up T. C. & I stock that Moore & Schley and many banks will fail] I don’t know whether the United States Steel Corporation can afford to buy this stock or not.  You know best as to that.  If it does not buy – if the United States Steel Corporation or someone else does not furnish relief – no man can say what the effect will be on the financial situation throughout the country.  If you can see your way clear to buy it, I have no doubt such action will relieve the situation.

<BR>
<BR>
[John Pierpont Morgan Jr] A man of known wealth, known integrity, and known ability, is largely entrusted with the money of his neighbours.
<BR><a href="j-p-morgan-quotes.html">J P Morgan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

[To William H Vanderbilt on disposing 250,000 of his shares of New York Central (more than 37% of the issued stock] There are two conditions, though, I would have to insist upon.

<BR><a href="j-p-morgan-quotes.html">J P Morgan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Mr Vanderbilt and the others have had their lesson.  They will not get out whole.  Roberts, you must come into this thing now or – you will be forced to come into it soon if only to control your connections.  Now you have a choice.  Soon you won’t have a chance to choose.
<BR><a href="j-p-morgan-quotes.html">J P Morgan<a/>
