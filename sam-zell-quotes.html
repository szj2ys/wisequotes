I am somebody who has been very fortunate to have had the opportunity to test my limits.  And I would remind you philosophically that my definition of a fool is somebody who has reached his limits.

<BR><a href="sam-zell-quotes.html">Sam Zell<a/>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
[In early 2008] Probably our toughest year is 2008.  It’s going to be a sh*tty year and we’re going to have to do a whole bunch of things to make sure that we don’t get hurt.  Number one, it’s manageable.  Number two, I have a lot of experience running and managing highly leveraged institutions.  And I don’t think this is any different than any of them.  I’m not a newspaper guy, I’m a businessman.  Therefore all that matters in the end is the bottom line, because as long as we have a bottom line we have a viable newspaper.  If we lose the bottom line or erode it significantly, then we’re all going to get buried together.  And that ain’t a good deal.
<BR><a href="sam-zell-quotes.html">Sam Zell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Salespeople] ought to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves, ‘Am I hungry?  Do I want to make a lot more money and do I want to work a lot harder?’  If the answer to all those questions is ‘yes,’ they’ve got a great future.  If they look in the mirror and say, ‘Gee, I’m an order taker and I don’t really want to work harder and I don’t want to do anything,’ then maybe the outlook is bleak.  Because part of what we’ve got to do here is make this company aggressive.  We’ve got to make everybody go for it.  I’m going for it, shouldn’t everybody else?  And particularly a sales force, because in the end we live and die by revenue.  And it’s that sales force that we’re depending on the revenue for.

<BR>
The grave dancer.
<BR><a href="sam-zell-quotes.html">Sam Zell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I like what I do, and society rewards it very highly.  Theoretical physicists solve problems, too, but society doesn’t necessarily commend their endeavours so highly.
<BR><a href="sam-zell-quotes.html">Sam Zell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On what he looks for in hiring people] I look for people who in no way, shape, or form can be intimidated.  My greatest fear is somebody telling me what they think I might want to hear.
<BR><a href="sam-zell-quotes.html">Sam Zell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Deals work when they have owners.  There are a lot of good companies that are rapidly turning into bad companies by virtue of inaction, inattention, lack of capital expenditures, and, most important of all, lack of owners.  Deals don’t work when in fact the guy calling the shots does not have his proverbial…  I guess I was going to say, ‘tit in the wringer,’ but be that as it may, they don’t work.
<BR><a href="sam-zell-quotes.html">Sam Zell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Investment banking advisers are] The people who brought you leprosy now selling you the cure.  
<BR><a href="sam-zell-quotes.html">Sam Zell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When you have committees, you have to have meetings, when you have meetings you have to have lunch or dinner or both.  Businesses are eroding while the lenders are fighting about where we’re going to have lunch next and dealing with investment bankers and the committees.
<BR><a href="sam-zell-quotes.html">Sam Zell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We told everyone that our financial objective was to not lose money, and the upside would take care of itself.
<BR><a href="sam-zell-quotes.html">Sam Zell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 1991] I clearly have no intention of being a bondholder.  If I’m going to make an investment, I’m going to be an owner of equity.
<BR><a href="sam-zell-quotes.html">Sam Zell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As an investor, I look at real estate as an area where we’re dealing with hard assets and brick and mortar.  There may be a lot of people who get a lot of joy out of virtual assets, but somehow or other, there’s a great deal of comfort that comes from being able to see and touch and understand.
<BR><a href="sam-zell-quotes.html">Sam Zell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve been in the real estate business for 40 years and I’ve always been fascinated by its creativity, its evolutions.  I probably have been a significant factor in this most recent evolution revolution.
<BR><a href="sam-zell-quotes.html">Sam Zell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On it being supply and demand that makes real estate appreciate, not inflation] That is correct.
<BR><a href="sam-zell-quotes.html">Sam Zell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the reduction of the amount of REIT’s in America] The process of the survival of the fittest will ultimately prevail…
