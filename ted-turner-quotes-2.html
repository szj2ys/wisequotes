<BR>
 [On Jimmy Brown] My father worked a lot, and didn’t spend much time with me.  I was really raised by this black man.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I would clearly say my friendship with Jimmy Brown has made me a great believer in equal rights and equality for all people.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
To me the capitalist system is still the best way to get things done… what a great system!
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I don’t think I’d like to go to heaven.  I just can’t see myself sitting on a cloud and playing a harp day in and day out.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I refuse to answer any questions about things that happened 23 years ago.  It’s a waste of time.  I don’t think about the past, I think about the future.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On saying that persistence was the key to success in signboard advertising] I’d like to point out that we’re tenacious, we don’t accept marginal locations.  We pick the location that we want and then keep going back until we get it.  In fact, we literally hound the people to death in a nice way.  Personally, I’ve had people throw up their hands after forty hours with them on about thirty calls and say, ‘Ok, ok.’
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On selling advertising] My Daddy said, ‘If advertisers want a blow job, you get down on your knees.’
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[To his father on his high expectations] You’re not leaving the business to me.  You’re leaving me to the business.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On getting bank finance] What you do is you get a bank, and you borrow all you can borrow.  You borrow so much they can’t foreclose on you.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On frugally reusing postage stamps] I took the letters to our mail room and made them cut off and re-use the stamps.  I figured I made a dime on every stamp.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve been through a lot of campaigns.  I’m only 54, but I’ve already got the mileage of a 150 year old man.  I’m like a New York City taxicab that has three drivers driving 25 hours a day, seven days a week.  I’m still pretty tough.  I’m still building this company.  I haven’t done everything I want to do.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I was cable when cable wasn’t cool.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I’m like the bear that went over the mountain to see what he could see.  One thing opened up another, and I kept moving on.  Remember, I went from a small sailboat on Lake Lanier to the America’s Cup.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I knew it was going to be hard to convince the New York advertising community, but I had no idea how hard.  My first team of salesmen ended up like the soldiers in the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan.  They were mowed down to a man.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On being asked ‘What do you think you have accomplished fro the good of mankind?’]  Well, I’m only 44.  I think I’m just getting started.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I’m going after the networks.  I’m going to scare the hell out of them.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I understand these Indians who are performing tonight are very peaceful.  I mean, I don’t want them scalping any of our critics here.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I never could understand why owners like to sit up behind bulletproof glass sipping martinis.  I sit in the front row.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
The trouble with me is I say what I think.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I keep moving.  I never seem to have time to stop and to reflect on past accomplishments.  I’m looking more into the future…

<BR>
A visionary is supposed to have a vision of the future.  I think I was right most of the time.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Decisions have to be made as close to the action as possible.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Where I come from, every man is a king.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
In the world of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I take vitamins.  I try not to eat starches, don’t eat desserts, try to stay away from sweets and between meal snacks, and I brush with Crest twice a day…
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
If you had as much to say as I do, you’d get into trouble too.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I bet you’re all wondering what it feels like to be a billionaire. It’s disappointing really… I’ve learned that great wealth isn’t nearly as good as average sex.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I wanted it to be harder for my sons than other kids.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
You can’t pave the whole world over with asphalt and still live on it.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I got an island and I know that the ocean is rising, because I watched my beach get washed away.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
<BR>
<BR>
[On seeing his name for the first time in 1982 on the Forbes richest list] Hmm, I can do a little better.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I’ve probably got more debt than anyone in the world.  That’s something, isn’t it?
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Values and achievements are much more important than possessions.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Being a billionaire or being a millionaire or being broke – and I’ve been all three at one time or another – it doesn’t make that much difference.  If you’ve been bitten by the capitalism bug, or the achievement bug, you want to be the best in whatever you do.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On becoming a billionaire] On the day they hit, I was so excited.  I wanted to tell someone.  But who?  I couldn’t tell my employees.  They’d say, ‘Great.  No pay me more money.’  I couldn’t tell my friends.  They weren’t nearly as wealthy as I was.  So I that evening told my wife as the kids were running around.  She said, ‘That’s great, but I have to deal with the kids right now.’
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I consider myself the luckiest man in the world.  I’ve achieved everything I’ve set out to achieve…
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I don’t want to upset the apple cart or make anybody mad.  I just want to be a banana, one of the bunch.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I don’t always flush.  Sometimes I just go out on the front porch and take a whiz on the grass.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
People who are in love never want to hurt anybody, you know that?  It’s only horny people who shoot people.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
It’s good for my humility.  As my father used to say, ‘A few fleas on a dog help remind him of what he is.’
