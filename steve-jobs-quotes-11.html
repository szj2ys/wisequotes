And if it was about me, I would have gotten really pissed off, and I didn’t want to get pissed at my sister, so I didn’t read it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[Later on a novel called A Regular Guy by Mona his sister]  About 25% of it is totally me, right down to the mannerisms.  And I’m certainly not telling you which 25%.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Every other CEO I know has a security detail.  It’s a nutso way to live.  We just decided that’s not how we wanted to raise our kids.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Is Disney happy with Pixar?  ‘Yes’ said Jeffrey Katzenberg.  Do you think we at Pixar are happy with Disney?  …  No, we’re not.  We want to do a film with you.  That would make us happy.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Jeffrey Katzenberg] He had Toy Story all messed up.  He wanted Woody to be a bad guy, and when he shut us down we kind of kicked him out and said, ‘This isn’t what we want,’ and did it the way we always wanted.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Since Snow White was released, every major studio has tried to break into the animation business, and until now Disney was the only studio that had ever made a feature animated film that was a blockbuster.  Pixar has now become the second studio to do that.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We at Pixar are the real thing and you Disney guys are sh*t.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>After Toy Story’s success I realized that we needed to cut a new deal with Disney if we were ever to build a studio and not just be a work-for-hire place.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Because we could now fund half the cost of our movies, I could demand half the profits.  But more important, I wanted co-branding.  These were to be Pixar as well as Disney movies.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Disney threatening to make its own sequels to Toy Story] That would have been like molesting our children.  John [Lasseter] started crying when he considered that possibility.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>He [Michael Eisner] didn’t think we could have many hits, so he thought he was saving himself some money.  Ultimately that was great for us, because Pixar would have ten blockbusters in a row.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Eisner was reasonable and fair to me then.  But eventually, over the course of a decade, I came to the conclusion that he was a dark man.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We want Pixar to grow into a brand that embodies the same level of trust as the Disney brand.  But in order for Pixar to earn this trust, consumers must know that Pixar is creating the films.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Innovation has virtually ceased.  Microsoft dominates with very little innovation.  Apple lost.  The desktop market has entered the dark ages.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Windows has won.  It beat the Mac, unfortunately, it beat UNIX, it beat OS/2.  An inferior product won.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Sculley destroyed Apple by bringing in corrupt people and corrupt values.  They cared about making money – for themselves mainly, and also for Apple – rather than making great products.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Macintosh lost to Microsoft because Sculley insisted on milking all the profits he could get rather than improving the product and making it affordable.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Microsoft simply ripped off what other people did.  Apple deserved it.  After I left, it didn’t invent anything new.  The Mac hardly improved.  It was a sitting duck for Microsoft.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I decided I’m not a hostile-takeover kind of guy.  If they had asked me to come back, it might have been different.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On wanting to talk with Gil Amelio new Apple CEO] I want to come over and see you.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>There’s only one person who can rally the Apple troops, only one person who can straighten out the company.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’m on my way to Japan, but I’ll be back in a week and I’d like to see you as soon a I return.  Don’t make any decision until we can get together.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Jean-Louis Gassee is one of the few people in my life I would say is truly horrible.  He knifed me in the back in 1985.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On talking about selling NeXT to Apple] It’s probably a totally crazy idea.  I’ll structure any kind of deal you want – license the software, sell you the company, whatever.  When you take a close look, you’ll decide you want more than my software.  You’ll want to buy the whole company and take all the people.   <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>You know, Larry [Ellison], I think I’ve found a way for me to get back into Apple and get control of it without you having to buy it.  ‘But Steve there’s one think I don’t understand.  If we don’t buy the company how can we make any money?’ asked Ellison.  Larry, this is why it’s really important that I’m your friend.  You don’t need any more money.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I think if I went back to Apple, and I didn’t own any of Apple, and you didn’t own any of Apple, I’d have the moral high ground.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On joining the Apple board] Gil [Amelio], that really hurts.  This was my company.  I’ve been left out since that horrible day with Sculley.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I didn’t get any sleep last night.  I was thinking about all the things that need to be done and about the deal we’re making, and it’s all running together for me.  I’m really tired now and not thinking clearly.  I just don’t want to be asked any more questions.  Look, if you have to tell them something, just say advisor to the chairman.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’m very excited, I’m looking forward to get to reknow some old colleagues.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[When asked whther he was going to end up taking over Apple] Oh no, Louise [Kehoe].  There are a lot of other things going on in my life now.  I have a family.  I am involved at Pixar.  My time is limited, but I hope I can share some ideas.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>I keep thinking about all the time away from my family this will cause, and the time away from the other family at Pixar.  But the only reason I want to do it is that the world will be a better place with Apple in it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Gil didn’t want me around.  And I thought he was a bozo.  I knew that before I sold him the company.  I thought I was just going to be trotted out now and then for events like Macworld, mainly for show.  That was fine, because I was working at Pixar.  I rented an office in downtown Palo Alto where I could work a few days a week, and I drove up to Pixar for one or two days.  It was a nice life.  I could slow down, spend time with my family.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We’ve got to get the spark back.  The Mac didn’t progress much in ten years.  So Windows caught up.  So we have to come up with an OS that’s even better.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I wanted to make sure the really good people who came in from NeXT didn’t get knifed in the back by the less competent people who were then in senior jobs at Apple.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[Calling Jon Rubinstein] Apple needs some help.  Do you want to come aboard?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>God gave us ten styluses.  Let’s not invent another.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>You ought to kill Newton.  Shut it down, write it off, get rid of it.  It doesn’t matter what it costs.  People will cheer you if you got rid of it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I thought to myself, I either tell him the truth, that Gil is a bozo, or I lie by omission.  He’s on the board of Apple, I have a duty to tell him what I think; on the other hand, if I tell him, he will tell Gil, in which case Gil will never listen to me again.  All of this took place in my head in less than thirty seconds.  All of this took place in my head in less than thirty seconds.  I finally decided that I owed this guy the truth.  I cared deeply about Apple.  So I just let him have it.  I said this guy is the worst CEO I’ve ever seen, I think if you needed a licence to be a CEO he wouldn’t get one.  When I hung up the phone, I thought, I probably just did a really stupid thing.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>When Larry [Ellison] relayed this story to me, we were in this sushi place, and I literally fell off my chair laughing.  He was just such a buffoon, and he took himself so seriously.  He instated that everyone call him Dr. Amelio.  That’s always a warning sign.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Larry [Ellison] brings this up now and then.  I try to explain my role at Apple is to be an advisor.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-16.html">16<a/> </p><p><BR>
