<BR>
Even though we had five kids at that time and Dad was just a fireman, we were better off than some of our neighbors.  
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[As a child when a movie was ten cents.] A dime was a lot in those days.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On helping the Hogan family across the road who had a bigger family.] Mom and Dad would give Fred and Bob and me a dime to go and then, on occasion, they’d give us an extra dime so we could each take a Hogan kid.  
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his grandfather after his grandmother had passed away.] On Friday nights, he used to go the Moose Club and he’d come home with too much beer and invariably, Grandpa, going upstairs to the second floor, would fall down.  Mom would call us and Fred Jr. and I would go and help Grandpa get up and make sure he made it.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My Grandfather was the only one in the house that drank.  Of course, because of him, I got to have a beer once in a while because I’d help him break up his tobacco up for his pipe and he would give me a taste of his beer.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On coming off the train in Detroit in 1942] Living in that little town in New Hampshire, I had never seen a black man, I had never seen an alley behind a house, I’d never seen a street car, I’d never seen a building more than three or four stories high.  I was a rube from the country, I really was.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was just a way of life.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
George Jenkins lived not too far from where this new house was and George and his wife, Harriet – she was a cousin of Mom’s – helped my mom and dad qualify for a mortgage.  He must have cosigned or something like that and we bought this house, which was two blocks away from where they lived.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The tuition at Holy Redeemer High School, when you were in parish, was $20 a semester, out of the parish it was $40.  That was a lot of money, but my mom and dad paid that…
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father] Not many people are that calm under those situations and he was terrific that way.  I’ll never forget that.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When I was in high school, there were a number of classmates whose parents had a business.  There were Terry and Denny McGovern.  Their parents had a funeral home right there in the neighborhood, McGovern’s funeral home.  Then there was a girl and, right there in the neighborhood, her parents had a little potato chip factory.  They had a brand name and they packaged them and that kind of thing.  I remember thinking how lucky those guys were.  Their parents had businesses.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Kelly brothers who’s parents owned a successful restaurant often driving to school.] Once in a while I’d get lucky and they’d give me a ride in the car.  After football practice when they had the car, we’d pull over to their father’s restaurant and we’d go down in the cellar and get a beer.  I think the old man probably knew it, but we went and had one beer and then we went back and showered and went home.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the difference between people who owned a business and those who merely worked for someone else.] My father was working at the Ford plant, you know, and these people were a different level than we were.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father working at the Ford plant] Most guys that graduated from high school in Detroit did that.  They’d become policemen or firemen or went to work in the plants – General Motors, Cadillac, Ford, all of them were there.  Those were good jobs.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On a neighbor Carl Hansen offering to drive him to school in the mornings instead of him having to commute.] I’d get up, and Carl lived a couple of doors down, and I’d just walk down and get in his car, and we’d go to school.  It was great.  I was lucky.  I think that the man had charm and polish and taste.  He was a quality guy.  He had more education than anybody in my family and he was an engineer.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One of his goals was to come back and beat the sh*t out of his little brother and he did.  He did a good job of it, too.  It was fun.  It was a great match and we talked about that for years afterwards and it was good.  It was part of family and part of growing up with a bunch of boys in that time frame.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was fortunate.  My mother had to go to work later and that had a big effect on my brothers and sisters.  Up until the time I graduated high school, Mom didn’t have to go to work.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I can’t look at my dad as a failure, but it was sad that my mother had to go to work for many years.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In the house, when we lived in Michigan, Grandma would talk French to Dad and Dad would, of course, answer his mother.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My high school academic record would make you think I wasn’t smart enough.  I have those records and, once in a while when I really feel like punishing myself, I look at them.  It’s terrible.

<BR>
[On his teacher changing the course of his life by getting him to give a graduation address on behalf of his fellow athletes.] I probably wouldn’t have gone to college.  I don’t know what I was going to do.  But she inspired me to do something different, because I would have probably taken a job in Detroit like my classmates.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I spent a lot of time with her, and obviously she was an intelligent school teacher and she just inspired me.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[His graduation speech as a C-minus student called ‘The American Way of Life’] Take your diploma, and with it your ambitions.  Keep your ideals close to your heart, and with your youth and energy go forth into this land and make your dreams come true.  For this is America, the land of opportunity.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his goal when he enrolled in Eastern Michigan University in 1948 (Then called Michigan State Normal College) of becoming a high school physical education teacher] Coming out of high school and being involved in sports, that’s what young guys wanted to do.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On having to continue to rely on his parents for some of his expenses at University.] I did most of it and they helped me where they could.  Mom and Dad, on the weekend, would give me four or five dollars.  That was all that they could do.  In fact, it was a big sacrifice at the time and more than I could have expected.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m ending my sophomore year in college and I’m a failure as a student.  I’m not really doing anything, and so I decide to enlist in the Marine Corps.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The best piece of advice I ever got in my life, I got from my brother Fred.  I was going into the Marine Corps and he told me, ‘Bruce, keep your eyes and ears open and your mouth shut.’  
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
They moved me up to squad leader.  Because I took their sh*t.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his first wife Gerry who he stayed with until she passed away in 1989.] I had a date with another girl I was dating the first night I got back.  The second night, I had a date with Gerry.  I never went back to the other girl.  It was just meant to be with us.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Gerry and I are going to get married.  We have no money and, of course, our families are regular working families.  And we’re trying to plan a weeding, which we did in Dearborn Heights at Warren Valley Golf Club.  The whole thing would cost $800, which was a fortune; I’m a private in the Marine Corps and I’m making $18 a month, something like that.  Gerry’s cousin, John Van Brunt, was working for a leather maker named Raymond Walk.  And Raymond Walk, through John, loaned Gerry and me the $800 to get married and to have this wedding.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his wedding gift money in February 1951] We care counting it out, because it was a fortune for us, and we got $1,300.  That was amazing.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Thirty years ago my wife and I were in Aspen on a skiing vacation, walking through town, and we came across a poster gallery.  Like a dutiful husband, I followed her into the store and stood there while the merchant showed us a bunch of big lithographs.  All of a sudden up comes a tire poster – it was a Michelin.  I wasn’t even aware they existed.  This one wasn’t really that expensive, and I thought, ‘I’ll buy it and hang it in the office someplace.’
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As I got into it, prices started climbing.  I wondered why.  Well, I was competing with myself.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On collecting antique tire posters.] I was dealing with several brokers and, essentially bidding against myself.  So I pulled out for a year, year and a half.  Prices came down to reality, so I continued to collect.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There’s over 100 years of history of the industry I’m involved in.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On tire posters.] Years ago in Europe this is how some young struggling artists made a living.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On vintage tire posters.] I especially like the ones of companies we’re still doing business with today.  The older ones appeal to me quite a bit, like the dark Pirelli poster from the 1920s.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On collecting Antique Tire Art posters] It beats collecting old tires, which are big and smell bad.
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The university gave me a lot.  I received a wonderful education and a wonderful lifetime experience.  
<BR><a href="bruce-halle-quotes.html">Bruce Halle<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On donating $1.5 million to Eastern Michigan University] I have fond memories of the University, and once I was able to, I wanted to do something for the school.  Part of the money was to go toward [endowing] a library, as that was a need for the University.
