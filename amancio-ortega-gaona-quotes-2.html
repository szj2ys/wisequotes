<BR>
<BR>
[In 2000] All of the chains in our group will continue to strive to bring their concept of fashion to new customers all over the world.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We will have to continue to win the confidence of the millions of people who frequent our stores on three continents with the quality of our work.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as we did in that first store which opened its doors… 25 years ago, we will expose ourselves daily to public scrutiny and attempt to seduce the customer with the latest fashion, the finest design, and the most attentive service.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
2001 was the year of Inditex’s flotation on the stock market.  Some 26.09 percent of the shares of Inditex were put on sale through an Initial Public Offering aimed at both individual and institutional investors.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2001] There are already more than forty countries with stores of any of Inditex’s formats.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We must highlight the launch in September 2001 of Oysho, the sixth format of Inditex.  Its international focus, in line with the general vocation of the Group, has already been confirmed with the opening of stores in several countries.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2001] Investment has developed in parallel to that of store openings, more than two hundred over the year.  As a result, consolidated sales have grown by 24 percent, reaching the figure of 3,250 million euros, while net income has reached 340 million euros, 31 percent more than in 2000.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2002] The presence of Zara in more than 20 European markets has now been seconded by other concepts, such as Massimo Dutti in France, Switzerland and UK or Bershka in Belgium and Switzerland.  
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2002] The soundness of Inditex’s business model has been a key factor in our performance in a year with an unfavourable worldwide economic situation.  Even in these conditions, comparable store sales have grown by 11%.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The good governance of the company – and a transparent decision – making process – is inscribed in the very culture of our group.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2002] All the professionals making up Inditex are keeping up their commitment to high quality standards, customer focus and innovation in their work.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2002] Of course, expansion will continue with the opening of new stroes for all the concepts and with entering new markets.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] We must first of all refer to the continuation of the effort made by our human team, which has seen its fruit in the growth in our net sales by 16% and the opening of more than 360 points of sale worldwide.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] An especially hot and long summer throughout Europe led to weak sales in the third quarter.  The flexibility offered by our business model made it possible for us to adapt our offer to this circumstance, which caused the number of units sold in this quarter to increase by 26% compared to the previous year.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] The main advantage of our model: flexibility to adapt our offer to market demands.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] We are maintaining our targets for growth, fundamentally in the most important markets on the European continent, where we will continue to concentrate openings both of Zara stores and of stores from other formats of the group.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] The dividend proposal made by the Board of Directors to the Shareholders Meeting, showing a strong increase through surplus dividend, signals the beginning of an upward curve in Inditex’s dividend pay-outs, with the aim of getting to 40% in the mid-term.  This does not signify by any means a department from our policy on investments, which are going to continue to grow at the previous rate, but rather is proof of our business’s great capacity to generate funds.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003 on Inditex’s commitment of the company to the rules of good governance] Inditex is receiving acknowledgements for its efforts in this respect, in which it will continue to persevere.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The results achieved in 2004 show a considerable improvement on 2003.  The 23% increase in turnover represents a return to the levels reached in prior years.  Similarly, net profit is up 41%, partly due to a large extent to the improvement in margins.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
At 53.5% in 2004, the company’s gross margin is up on recent years due to better sales management in all of our chains.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2004] Expansion has continued to focus on Europe, where more than 90% of the net openings took place.  After Spain, the majority of these new stores were opened in Italy, France, the United Kingdom and Germany – markets where the growth strategy is more intense – and in Portugal and Greece, countries in which we already had an important presence.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2004] Inditex now operates in all EU member states.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In 2004 the Group opened its first store in Hong Kong.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The successful combination of intense expansion and renewed business efficiency has only been possible through the immense effort of our team at all levels of the organization.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In 2004 we not only reached the 2,000 sales outlet mark worldwide, but we also achieved record returns on investment.  
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2004] We have proven that it is possible to both grow and maintain profitability levels by making the most of the competitive advantages of our business model as the Group becomes larger and more complex.  Meanwhile, we continue to set ambitious goals for the Group.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] Each employee’s sense of initiative, the enthusiasm our teams display in the course of their daily work and the motivation they convey to other teams are the real secrets of the Group’s success.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the major efforts of Inditex since its foundation has been to be an absolutely transparent company in the eyes of the world.  Inditex has kept an open-doors policy for everyone: customers, institutions, shareholders, investors, suppliers…
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It may be safely said that Inditex understands transparency not only as a formal obligation but, primarily as the way to show the stance of the company with regard to certain issues that both shareholders and employees, customers and social actors in general demand more insistently nowadays…
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] To know the social, labour and environmental consequences of our activity, in addition to the mere economic ones.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] The group presently accounts for more than 70,000 employees worldwide who make joint efforts day after day to improve themselves.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Two milestones were reached during 2006: the launching of the first stores in Mainland China, and the arrival of some of our concepts others than Zara to various markets in the area, such as Singapore, Thailand or Indonesia.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Since the approval of our Code of Conduct in 2001, in 2006 progress has been made in defining the action guidelines to ensure an adequate response to our commitment towards social and labour rights, and the improvement of life conditions in the surroundings of the production centres of our products.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] As regards working rights, Inditex has gone ahead of the legal regulations in force by including certain measures to reconcile work and family life and to ensure non discrimination in any field.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Retail business, as we understand it in Inditex, requires our constant attention in order to improve our model and give a quick response to the market demands and to the expectations of our customers.  
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] the company has actually kept its satisfactory growth pace and has met the strategic goals it had set, both financial and social, with a remarkable regularity.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] I would like to underscore an issue which in my view is essential in such a sizable Group as Inditex.  I am talking about the human ‘touch’: matters such as team building, internal motivation, promotion, reconciliation of work and family or training of officials, all of which are a key for a steady progress and success of a company such as ours.  This idea must permeate all the spheres of the company.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] We all know that the Group has opened 560 new stores in 50 different countries during the year.  This parameter not only shows the significant strategic growth decided by the Group, but most of all, it indicates the effort made by a great number of individuals…
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] We are dealing with an organization that is alive, where seniority and experience live together with new generations who contribute their innovative ideas to the wealth of the company.
<BR><a href="amancio-ortega-gaona-quotes.html">Amancio Ortega Gaona<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In 2007, upwards of 10,000 new employees have joined the Group, whose total staff amounts to 79,517 individuals of 140 nationalities.  This is undoubtedly one of the greater strengths of our Group, if not the greatest.
