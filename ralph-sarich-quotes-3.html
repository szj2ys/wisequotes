<BR>
[In August 1989 on BHP backing the Orbital Engine Company back in the early 1970’s.] BHP has never received public recognition for its contribution. But the truth is, if it wasn't for BHP we wouldn't be here. They deserve everything they get out of it - and for their investment they have made an awful big return and they took a big risk.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 1989] We haven't had big Government handouts. I personally never received anything from the Government - but BHP gained support worth $5.6 million for us from the Government. Many other companies have received more than 50pc.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 1989] I don't think the Australian Government is going to change its position and, besides, I've committed to manufacture in America.  I think my plate is full as far as commitments go.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 1989] If we'd announced an Australian manufacturing venture, by all past indications, our stock price would have fallen. But instead it went up.  That has added $150 million to $200 million to the capitalised value of the company    
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Even in recent times I’ve been called a conman and worse!  Who have I conned?  BHP, Ford and the banks who have invested in us?  If so, how do they continue to do business with us?
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2003 on plans for the development of 200 apartments in Perth and a Mandurah development] I think demand is still there; it’s just an issue of whether the product is right.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007 after having sold four commercial properties for $500 million and looking for alternative investments.] That’s our preferred direction [on property in the US], but if we found something in, say, the mining industry or even in technology, or anything like that, then that would be a good investment.  We’re essentially looking for a good investment.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] We see opportunities in the US because there have been some new buildings and some people are getting stretched.  Then we’re also going to look at Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Tokyo.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] We only have to have moderate gearing to be well over the $1 billion mark.  And the gearing I’m talking about is only what we’ve got on our offices.  Even though it shows up that we’ve sold almost $500 million, that had no gearing whatsoever.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] Generally companies, big institutions, would gear up to 70 to 80 percent, but we’d never go that high because I don’t want to take that sort of risk at my age.  We can quite comfortably gear at around the 35 percent mark.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] It’s good to have a geographic spread.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2008 on a donation of $20 million to help develop the neurosciences wing of the $360 million research centre at Queensland Elizabeth Medical Centre in Nedlands in Western Australia. (Health Minister Jim McGinty said this donation was the largest philanthropic donation ever made in WA)] [It] will be tasked with finding new treatments for a host of conditions including head injuries, brain tumours, epilepsy and spinal problems.  It will also work to address the heavy burden of Alzheimer’s disease that affects our community today.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2009] Our development commitments are aimed at a range of residential markets, however, we believe the empty-nester demographic will prove to be the strongest market sector over the coming years, particularly for top-end developments.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2009] After the economic turmoil of the past six to twelve months we are seeing an understandable degree of caution in the upper end of the [residential] market, but we believe the fundamentals that apply to the Noosa property market hold us in good stead into the future.  
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2009] Noosa stands to perform well in a recovering market, based on a shortage of well-sized apartments in a very tightly held location.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009 on the property market] I think there’s going to be quite a bit of pressure still on the liquidation of assets.  I’m surprised some of them have been able to hold through as long as they have.  
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009] I think there is going to be a little more blood-letting yet.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009 on Cape Bouvard concentrating on performance on equity as well as timing.] To do that, you need to be able to trade in and out of those assets.  Traditionally, a lot of those assets have been looked at as a long-term, but I disagree with that strategy.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009] I don’t think any asset in today’s global economy can be looked at as long-term.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009] I don’t think it’s the right time to be going in to buy yet.  I am not convinced the turnaround, certainly in WA, has moved as quickly as a lot of the press is purporting it has.  
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009] There’s still probably some rationalisation of assets which haven’t come into the market yet.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009] Perth’s still got a lot of space coming into the market, not only in new space but there’s still a lot of sub-leased space.  
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009] If you look closely, and end up buying any time in the next two or three year period, you’re going to be relatively safe in terms of the trough.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012] I put a considerable sum into the Fremantle Dockers when they got started, so I’m not against the game.  
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012 on plans for a $900 million football stadium at Burswood questioning the timing.] I just cannot comprehend why the priority is to build a new stadium rather than help struggling families desperate for housing.
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m quite happy working 12 hours a day… I don’t worry about money.  
<BR><a href="ralph-sarich-quotes.html">Ralph Sarich<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bonus
<BR>
<BR>
[Donating money is] A lot better feeling than making money from business.  It gives you a sense of immense satisfaction that you can help people in that way. <BR><B>Peter Sarich</B> (The son of Ralph and Pat Sarich)
<BR>
<BR>
[On Ralph Sarich in November 1976] A hard but fair taskmaster with a dominant and intense personality. 
<BR><B>Dr Swinkels</B> (A researcher who worked alongside him for three years)
