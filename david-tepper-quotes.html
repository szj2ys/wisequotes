I really wanted to learn about this trading business, and the guy running the desk at the time was not really a corporate guy.  He wasn’t good at understanding companies and was more familiar with how interest rates moved so he wasn’t really right for the job.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On moving to Goldman Sachs] Travelers cut Goldman off when they hired me.  It was a bit hard going in there because a few of the salesmen were so pissed off at me that Travelers wouldn’t do business with them.  But, by the end of the year, they decided to make me a trader because they thought I knew what I was doing.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>

<BR>
[On going in the 1987 stock market crash] Going into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short – I had no long positions.  I made a fortune during and after the crash.  It was very cool.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I used to be very good at history.

<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being asked to make some trades he didn’t think were appropriate and notifying the legal department] I just didn’t give a sh*t.  What was I going to do?  Trade for them when I think they’re doing something that’s wrong?  And then not see my kids again because I’ll get blamed for the trades?  So I didn’t do the trades, but I didn’t get made partner either.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>

People say that I basically kept going to Rubin instead of Corzine but it wasn’t for political reasons.  It was just because Rubin knew what was going on with equities and Corzine was a Treasury guy that didn’t know corporates.  I wasn’t disloyal to him, but I wasn’t one of his boys.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his older sister Sheryl bringing him into her second-grade class for show and tell] I was only four or five years old but I could already do multiplication and complex adding.  I could barely even talk at the time but I could do math.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was a big kid and was quiet in the beginning, but as I got into football in high school I turned into a joker and was well liked.  
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being asked by the hall guard what he was doing after his English teacher had thrown him out of class] My English teacher threw me out of class.  He told me to roam the halls and act like the animal I am.  I’m doing the best I can… I wouldn’t say I was a bad kid, though, just bored.

[When growing up] I remember my dad had made some small investments in a few companies, so I would track them and see how he was doing… but then the whole thing went bankrupt.  It was a bad investment, but that didn’t deter me.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On studying at the University of Pittsburgh] I had to pay for it myself.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was funny, in high school I never had an ‘A,’ but in college I almost never didn’t have an A.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had a scheme going where I was taking advantage of small moves in the market by buying options.  It was like clockwork.  I would put in orders at a sixteenth of a point and sell at an eighth and pay a dollar or two for commission and come out way ahead.  It was just a little anomaly in the market at the time, and it was really steady income.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think people should be self-reliant.  You should work and be self-sufficient.  That’s what I did.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m lazy competitive if you know what I mean.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The main thing that makes Appaloosa stand apart from the pack is the depth of our analysis and the fact that we’re not afraid to be the first one to act on our convictions.  If you look at our history over the years, we are usually the first mover in a country or situation, time and time again.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s the [fund] manager’s decision to make the right calls for the portfolio, not the investors.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have a combination of laid-back competitiveness on the field of play.  You see that with some athletes that come in with earphones on and are hanging with the music.  And then when you get them on the field, they’re focused and they’re fierce.  So in the outside world, I’m that easygoing person.  But if I’m on the field, I wanna win.  And we win a lot.
<BR><a href="david-tepper-quotes.html">David Tepper<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There’s no place to hide at Appaloosa.
