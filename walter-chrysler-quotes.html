Some people create their own opportunities, others go where opportunities are the greatest, others fail to recognize opportunity when they are face to face with it.

[On the future of the automobile whilst working as a superintendent of the Great Western Railroad] As I visualized its future, it far outran railway development, which in a sense had reached its zenith, because the automobile provided flexible, economical, individual transportation which could be utilized for either business or pleasure.  It knew not limits except a right-of-way, it was bounded by no greater restrictions than individual effort and will.  To me it was the transportation of the future and as such I wanted to be a part of it.  That was where I saw opportunity.

[On him purchasing a car for $5,000 – using family savings of $700 and borrowing the balance of $4,300 to do so] When my wife heard about it, it nearly broke up the family, for we were doing without many things in those days.  But there was some urge within me which made me buy that car.  When I got it home I promptly took it to pieces, and I think that in the three years it was in my possession I pulled it to pieces altogether about forty times.

[On purchasing his first car that he had for three years] I pulled it to pieces altogether about forty times.

[On what his secret was to be able to turn around bankrupt car companies?]  The first thing I do when I start to look into the affairs of a failing company is to study the personnel of the organization and the individuality of the men.  I am concerned first of all with executives, because if their principles are not right it is useless to look for results from the men.  When I have measured up in my own mind the capacity of the executives, I get out into the operation of the plant and watch the men.  I look around to see how many of them are standing still and how many of them are moving around the plant.  Highly paid workmen should be busy with accomplishment, not useless motion.  If there is a lot of movement I know the plant is being badly operated.
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I do not believe in idle machines or idle men.  Outside of the idle investment involved, it is bad policy.  If a man is working next to an idle machine it not only has a bad effect on him mentally, but he takes less care of his own machine because he thinks he has a ready substitute.  I believe in keeping people out of temptation, for many of them cannot resist it.
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have the floor space measured and estimate the amount of its productive capacity and then check up to see whether it is overcrowded or is running under its capacity, also whether the plant is over-manned.  If it is over manned and we are over-producing, I reduce the force arbitrarily.
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I proceed to get the organization into shape by cutting out every unnecessary expense and wasteful practice the minute I discover it.  Some forms of non-productive effort are necessary in every organization, because all forms of service ware not productive in themselves; even though they contribute to the general plan; but to allow wasteful practices to continue after they have been analyzed and proved wasteful is to sap the energy of your organization at its source.
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The majority of men pay too much attention to the way stations and not enough to the terminals.
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When railroad engineers come to a mountain they do not always go through it; sometimes it is best to go around it.  Success comes through a judicious expenditure of energy.  Sometimes it takes less to go around, and serves the same purpose.
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Men should look forward, and progress stops when they refuse to listen to other people’s opinions, although they should make their own decisions.  I never want to get to the place where I so dominate the job that no one under me dares to make suggestions.
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I gauge them through my intuition and experience.  Then, too, these cuts in the organization give me a big opportunity to learn something about my man power.  I find out how might fight the men have in them and learn about their individual force.  By cutting to the quick I get rapid contacts and am able to measure up my men’s resourcefulness under emergency conditions without delay. 
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On setting up budgets and financial quotes for a new organization] We have our statisticians set up the amount necessary for administrative purposes, which is based on a conservative quota.  The items cover the capacity of the plant, productive labor, non-productive labor, productive materials, non-productive materials, all fixed charges, depreciations, sales administration, and executive administration.  These are all counted in on the cost per car.
