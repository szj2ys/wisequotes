People need to feel very good about their achievements.  They get pride from what they are doing.
<BR><a href="carlos-slim-helu-quotes.html">Carlos Slim Helu<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Work that is done well is not only a responsibility to one’s self and to society, it is also an emotional need.  You cannot live without doing something; [you need] a direction in life.  It’s very important for leaders in business to work to create human capital, a team that has the same sense of purpose and alignment.  They will feel that they are doing something that is important for society and the people around them.  That is very important, along with having achievements.

Distribute a good part of the fruits, not the branches of the tree, and ‘reinvest’ part of the fruit sees to grow more trees and create wealth.

Wealth should be created by investing to create more wealth.  Income is the fruit of wealth.  If you do not do that, you will not have more income.
<BR><a href="carlos-slim-helu-quotes.html">Carlos Slim Helu<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The more income you have in the economy, the more middle class you will have, the strongest market [will] develop, and the best society develops.  I don’t believe you need to create wealth first and then distribute wealth.  Wealth is created because the market, society, the welfare [of the people], and the economy are growing… Development is sustained and grown with the employment and welfare of the population.

Government resources are not enough to solve social or economic problems.  We have to create wealth and employment… The only way you finish with poverty is with jobs.  To have better jobs you have to have better education.
<BR><a href="carlos-slim-helu-quotes.html">Carlos Slim Helu<a/>
<BR>

The paradigms of the old society are very different to the paradigms of the new society.

<BR>
The paradigms today are freedom, democracy, liberty, creativity, innovation, competition, globalization, human rights, environment etc.  These paradigms will change these societies.
<BR><a href="carlos-slim-helu-quotes.html">Carlos Slim Helu<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On how Mexico will change in September 2008] In the new society I see it very easy to product goods and services very efficiently at a very low cost and produce wealth.  But if you don’t make the right conduction the change is a great crisis.

To fight poverty is not with charity.  [It] Is not with social programs.   You need to give nutrition for the mother, child and student.  Health and employment.  You need to bring high quality education.
<BR><a href="carlos-slim-helu-quotes.html">Carlos Slim Helu<a/>

As you bring more education you have a more diverse city of jobs.  You can find jobs more easily than if you only know how to do one thing.

<BR>
<BR>
