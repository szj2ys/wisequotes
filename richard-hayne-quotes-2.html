<BR>
[In June 2003 when a core target market is aged 18 to 26.] If you are fiftysome years old, as I am, and your job is to figure out what a 21-year-old woman wants to wear to attract a male, there is probably something wrong.  She certainly doesn't want me to know what that is.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2003 on encouraging his buyers to push the edge.] If everything a buyer is putting in the store is selling, then they are not taking enough risks, they are not experimenting enough.  It's not rocket science. We just try to give our customers what they want: something to wear on a Friday night that will make the boys look at them -or the girls look at them. We have two rules: 'It's okay to fail' and 'Never look in the rearview mirror.'
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 1984 on not charging credit-card fees.] We wouldn’t want to offend those people.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1984 on retail sales.] It’s not all gloom and doom.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 1985 on retailers in order to get business having]  To fight and scrape.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 1987 on a surge in CPI costs including on women’s clothing.] You’re just starting to see some of the enormous increases in prices that will definitely continue in the fall.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 1997 on closing it’s original store in a University of Pennsylvania neighborhood where business isn’t what it used to be.] It wasn’t meeting our sales expectations – there’s nothing more, nothing less.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2000] While sales strengthened somewhat toward the end of the quarter, especially in the important category of women’s apparel, inventory levels remain above plan entering the fourth quarter, and we expect some pressure on margins during the holiday period.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2003] We had an outstanding second quarter, delivering double-digit compstore sales gains, improving margins and leveraging occupancy and SG&A expenses.  This allowed us to post the most profitable quarter in the company’s 33 year history.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2004] No two of our stores are the same.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At a mall you can almost get frostbite, it’s so boring.  Looking different is worth a lot.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Urban Outfitters organization in January 2004 is] Like two sides of the brain working together.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On spending ten months freezing near the Bering Sea in Alaska in 1969] It was like getting an arm amputated.  No TV, no radio, almost no electricity.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On opening the first store with $4,000 to serve the college crowd and cash poor hippies.] Kids just like us.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2005 on plans for new head office.  Modern office buildings] Didn’t sit well with the soul of our company.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2005 on being asked by Fidelity’s Will Danoff - ‘Dick, what do you do differently?  What’s the secret sauce?’] We’ve stayed decentralized.  We’re a chain, but as far as the customer is concerned, each store looks like a boutique.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006 on whether he felt regrets or had second thoughts about potentially offensive products.] Very, very, very rarely.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2006] Long term trends reveal that retailing is decreasingly about offering a collection of products and more about creating compelling customer experiences – ones that integrate the shopping environment with the product assortment and the marketing.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2006] Our ability to produce strong financial results does not rest with any one particular fashion look.  Over time, it flows from our ability to create a shopping experience that connects with the customer on an emotional level.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] I don’t like paying taxes – is that a sin?  I like small government.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
[On moving all 625 employees to the Navy Yard and what the lure was.] We have a number of people who wanted to bring their dogs to work.  So when we first started looking at high-rise buildings downtown, even if dogs were allowed, which they weren’t, I thought, ‘Where would they walk them?’
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2007] We want to stay small.  We do not want to be commercial, which is the biggest enemy of cool.  We want our stores to be boutique-like, as opposed to a chain.  What is a chain?  A chain is somebody coming up with a concept, executing it, and reproducing it exactly, like a formula.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On a concept that they tried on Sixth Avenue being exactly what Urban Outfitters did not want to do.  But an attempt at pushing creative boundaries.] Disney-fication.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the type of people they hire.  They have three qualities.] They have to be creative, reasonably intelligent, and have a sense of style.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Some companies doe not care about design: for them it is an expense, not the profit.  We believe design and creativity generates everything.  The whole Urban Outfitters brand comes from designers.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2007 on a new retail brand.] Sites will be large and free standing.  Merchandise will include lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants and flowers.  
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2007 on his new ‘greenhouse inspired’ retailing concept.] Our new concept is designed to appeal to men and women interested in a creative, sophisticated experience.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2011 on their new head office in the Navy Yard.] When we moved in here I can tell you there were a great number of skeptics, inside and outside the company.  They said, ‘You’re crazy.’  Four and a half years later, we have created the nicest corporate campus in America, I would say with all due humility.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] I am pleased that we managed our inventories to appropriate levels at year end even though our margins during the quarter suffered as a result.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2002] We believe that the quarter’s double-digit comp store sales increase bodes well for our holiday season.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2007] We have seen steady improvement in the reaction to our fashion offerings over the past few months.  Both the Anthropologie and Free People brands delivered positive 'comp' store sales for the month of February and since we will anniversary negative 'comps' each quarter this fiscal year, we feel guardedly optimistic about achieving our modest sales plans for the year.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2012 on him taking over from Glen T Senk as CEO of Urban Outfitters.] Glen joined the company nearly 18 years ago when the Anthropologie business was a single-store prototype. We are forever grateful for his passion, creativity and leadership in building the Anthropologie brand to what it is today. We are also thankful for his countless contributions having served as the URBN CEO since 2007.  We wish Glen all the best in his future endeavours.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012] We are excited to partner with World Co., Ltd to help us expand the Free People brand in Japan.  Free People designs compelling merchandise with a strong lifestyle message, and World brings deep expertise and a track record of marketing success in Japan. Together we expect to build the same customer awareness and brand loyalty in the Japanese Market that Free People currently enjoys domestically.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] For those of you who don’t know me, I co-founded Urban Outfitters 42 years ago and have been actively involved ever since.  When I stepped down as CEO in 2006, I remained on as Chairman and helped to set our strategic agenda.  I’m now back as CEO and excited by the opportunity to lead and grow this Company once again.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] I have a deep commitment to the Company, its brands, the employees and the stakeholders.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] At URBN, we see ourselves as customer specialists – a collection of brands – each one specializing in one particular customer group, a particular lifestyle or life stage.  We offer her things she wants in environments that inspire her.  We talk to her and listen to her ideas and opinions.  In short, we have a relationship with our customer and that relationship translates into sales.  
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Each brand has an abundance of opportunities… We have the financial resources and now we have the leadership talent to develop these opportunities.  
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] We have all the key ingredients in place: strong brands that resonate with the existing customer, the strategy to expand the reach of each brand, the capital to support the growth and the leadership to direct it.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2012] We had some help from Mother Nature but unusually warm weather was not the only factor driving sales.  Our brands successfully capitalized on new fashion trends that have emerged.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2012] My goals for the business when I returned to the position of CEO four months ago were threefold.  The first was to fill all top management positions with the right talent.  Second was to develop a clear and concise strategy to re-ignite our top line growth, and third, was to ensure the Brand leaders had the tools, the talent and the capital to execute that strategy.
