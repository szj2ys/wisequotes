[On the Pratt Family Board] Not a statutory board of directors per se.  It is a board of advice.  So it is a bit different to a public company in that respect.  It meets a few times a year.

[If a person’s greatness is measured by his philanthropic endeavours.] My father was a giant among men.

<BR>
<BR>
