<BR><B>Samuel Johnson</B>

Be kind to thy father, for when thou wert young,
Who loved thee so fondly as he?
He caught the first accents that fell from thy tongue,
And joined in thy innocent glee.

A ‘daddy’s little girl’ is the one who would rather get her hands covered in engine oil with dad, than stay in the house and bake buns with her mother! 
<BR><B>Mishelly</B>
<BR>

<BR>
To be a successful father . . . there's one absolute rule: when you have a kid, don't look at it for the first two years.
<BR><B>Ernest Hemingway</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
You need three things in life to be happy: 1) Something to do 2) Something to look forward to and 3) Someone to love.  … In remembrance of a wonderful dad – my dad.

My father died many years ago, and yet when something special happens to me, I talk to him secretly not really knowing whether he hears, but it makes me feel better to half believe it.

A true father is always there. He is there to spill tears of happiness when his eyes fall upon his infant daughter. He is there with arms to catch her when she takes her first steps or stumbles. He is there to teach her at the youngest age, even though she might not understand half of it. He is there to help her color inside the lines, make her grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, and tie her shoes. He is there to hug her and kiss her on her first days of school, and to walk her in if need be. He is there to teach her and tease her and laugh with her. He is always there to embarrass her, but that’s part of life. He is there to tell her to go ask her mother, when her mother told her to ask him. He is there to lecture her, prepare her for the monster called high school. He is there to put up with her teenage moods and her co-ed relationships. He is there to approve, disapprove, accept and forgive. He is there to give her a big bundle of flowers when she graduates, to smile when her name is called and feel proud. He is there to embrace her and kiss her before she goes to live and learn a thousand miles away. He is there to see her become a workingwoman, to walk her down the aisle (or not, if her independence and stubbornness prevail after all). He is there to watch her grow as the lines on his face grow. He is there to welcome her home, always, and let her hug him and smell the smell she remembers from childhood, the warm, protecting, comforting smell of dad. But most of all, he is always there to love her. And she is always there to love him back. Dad, I love you, happy Father’s Day.

Blessed indeed is the man who hears many gentle voices call him father! 
<BR><B>Lydia M Child</B>

That is the thankless position of the father in the family-the provider for all, and the enemy of all.
<BR><B>J August Strindberg</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Dad - Ask him when Mom says no.

My father gave me the greatest gift anyone could give another person, he believed in me.
<BR><B>Jim Valvano</B>

Every mother generally hopes that her daughter will snag a better husband than she managed to do...but she's certain that her boy will never get as great a wife as his father did.
<BR><B>Anonymous</B>

None of you can ever be proud enough of being the child of SUCH a Father who has not his equal in this world-so great, so good, so faultless. Try, all of you, to follow in his footsteps and don't be discouraged, for to be really in everything like him none of you, I am sure, will ever be. Try, therefore, to be like him in some points, and you will have acquired a great deal.
<BR><B>Queen Victoria</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
It is not flesh and blood but the heart which makes us fathers and sons. 
<BR><B>Johann Schiller</B>

<BR><B>Alice Walker</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Men should always change diapers. It's a very rewarding experience. It's mentally cleansing. It's like washing dishes, but imagine if the dishes were your kids, so you really love the dishes.
<BR><B>Chris Martin</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When a father gives to his son, both laugh; when a son gives to his father, both cry.
<BR><B>William Shakespeare</B>
<BR>
<BR>
My dad has always taught me the importance of relationships. When I was a kid, I used to go around with him in the car when he was a salesman for the business. These guys would regularly tell me how important he was to them and what a special relationship they had with him. It’s a lesson I’ll never forget.
<BR><B>Anthony Pratt</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I bought and sold over three hundred bicycles from the time I was thirteen until I was sixteen. I often wonder if my dad had been able to afford to buy me a bike and had never suggested I build one, whether I would have had such an invaluable experience. I think not.

<BR>
You must teach your children that the ground beneath their feet is the ashes of your grandfathers. So that they will respect the land, tell your children that the earth is rich with the lives of our kin.

[On Jimmy Brown] My father worked a lot, and didn’t spend much time with me. I was really raised by this black man.
<BR><a href="ted-turner-quotes.html">Ted Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My father held a magnifying glass so that the rays of sun focused on the fender of our old car – the pain peeling right off! The magnificent magnifying glass taught me for the first time the powerful principle of focus.
<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Fathers and sons arrive at that relationship only by claiming that relationship: that is by paying for it. If the relationship of father to son could really be reduced to biology, the whole earth would blaze with the glory of fathers and sons.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[His father’s advice] Johnny, never cease trying to be the best you can be. Try your hardest; make the effort; do your best.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>

A simple question that can make a huge difference was suggested to me by Leo Buscaglia who has contributed so much in the area of human relations. When he was young, Leo’s father asked him every night, ‘What have you learned today?’ The boy knew he had to have an answer – and a good one. If he hadn’t learned anything interesting in school that day, he’d scurry for the encyclopaedia. Decades later, Leo still won’t go to bed until he’s learned something new and valuable for the day. How could your life or your children’s lives be immeasurable enhanced by adding this question or one like it, to your daily routine? In what ways could you make this process as fundamental as eating or sleeping?

<BR>
My father taught me to always do more than you get paid for as an investment in your future.
