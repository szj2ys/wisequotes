[In June 2003] Judy [Wicks] has so integrated her politics into her business, and God bless her, but that’s not what we are about.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2003] We are about giving 3,600 people a job and an opportunity for advancement, a chance to live their lives as they see fit.  Somewhere that became viewed as somehow wrong.  But the fact is Judy [Wicks] was involved in the store for a year and a half 33 years ago.  Let’s get over it.  She has her life and I’ve got mine.  I spent 31 and a half years developing this company when she wasn’t around.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I would never and did not ever characterize myself as a hippie.  But it is fair to say we were influenced by the fashion of the times.  So if having long hair is equated with hippiedom, then one could make that mistake.  But I never called myself a ‘hippie.’

[On originally calling Urban Outfitters - ‘Free People’] Seemed very appropriate for the time - it was a very political time.  It had a political connotation at the time, and it probably almost has the exact opposite political connotation it has now... The connotation in 1970 was about the lifestyle of that generation, and the connotation today is much more American flag.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On changing Urban Outfitters store name from ‘Free People’ to ‘Urban Outfitters’.  The Vietnam War] Had been incredibly divisive, and there was just this amazing change of mood.  People wanted to forget about it.  The name 'Free People' had some political connotations, and they were growing tired.  They were quickly becoming out of fashion.  It happened to be the time when we were just putting together the deal to move to a much larger space and felt that, in conjunction with that, we should change our name.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1979 when he was told about a like minded store in Harvard Square that was in need of some working capital that was to become their second store.]  That was the understatement of the day – they were basically bankrupt.  We negotiated the purchase and got the lease.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>

<BR>
[On having stores in New York, Philadelphia and Washington.] Amtrak Corridor.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On a minor setback when he tried to add clothes for men aged 30 something into the retail mix.] For a suburban managed 30 to 40, hell is going clothing shopping on a Saturday afternoon.  There are about 5,000 other things they would put on the list ahead of clothes shopping.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2003] As a company, we don’t contribute to any cause except noncontroversial things like a breast cancer walk.  I don’t know anybody who is for breast cancer.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2003 on Rick Santorum] I don’t want to mislead you.  Like many people, I have some affinity for Rick Santorum, and I have problems with some of his positions.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2003] Our job as a business is not to promote a political agenda.  That’s not what we do.  There are all kinds of political views held by my employees.  Some would be horrified to learn that we contributed to Santorum's campaign, and others would be fine with it. We openly discuss and joke about our political differences.
<BR><a href="richard-hayne-quotes.html">Richard Hayne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2003 on where clothes are manufactured like other clothing lines.] Years ago I visited one of the factories we work with in India, and there was 500 people standing in a line three people deep stretching around the building.  I said to the foreman, 'What's going on?' He told me they were all applicants for the four positions they had open. I toured that facility and it was reasonably clean- for India. And it was reasonably well-lit -again, for India. And yes, it was mostly young women working there. But it is my understanding that the only other option those women had to feed their families was selling their bodies. So I don't want to hear people from the suburbs with their fat American stomachs telling people in other countries how to run their societies.
