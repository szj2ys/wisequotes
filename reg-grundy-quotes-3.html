‘I guess I recuperate fast.’  This phrase has entered the Grundy household over the years and Joy and I say it to one another if one of us is off colour, simply to get a smile.

<BR>
Boxing is a sport where gladiators meet and embrace after the final bell, no matter how tough the contest has been.  They respect one another and often become firm friends at the end of their careers.

<BR>
<BR>
[On a early morning show of his.] There was no tape recording then, no editing.  I drew chalk cue marks on each disc.  I had only two turntables and it was a test of dexterity swapping discs: queuing them, holding them in place as the heavy turntables spun beneath them, then releasing each disc at the crucial moment to add to the melodic patterns I was weaving…
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In the early days.] Who knows how it sounded going to air, but there were no listener complaints; perhaps that was because I had so few listeners.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Life was great.  Ideas were flowing, but I was just an unknown announcer on a station with a minuscule audience.  So I did what I could to get attention.  I packed my shift with ideas such as offering myself as a babysitter to the female listener who sent me the best letter.  
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I would have stood on my head for a paragraph in one of the papers – a bit different from the way I’ve been these past thirty years, after I decided to drop off the radar.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes it worked.  It was always worth a try.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Churchill once said, ‘Bite off more than you can chew and chew like buggery.’  That sounded like good advice to me, so I decided to take on as many sports as I could, even if I knew nothing about them.  I had a go at everything that came along.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think management had given up trying to stop me doing anything.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On him commentating a game of Rugby League.] As Ron Casey later said, ‘Reg knew as much about League as I do about French impressionism.  Bugger all, really.  But he learned quickly.’

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I was building a career in radio, and I was earning a living – just… The station paid me nothing as a football commentator but I did get the commission from the advertising.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My total weekly take-home pay was more than the 7 pounds 10 shillings a week I had started on.  But not much more.  And I was working day and night, six days a week.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was so successful as a salesman that 2SM lowered my commission rate.  It was a setback but, what the heck; I was having a great time.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Then I told 2SM’s general manager, Bernie Stapleton, what I’d done.  ‘You mean you’ve committed us without any authority from me or the management of this radio station?’… ‘Well, I must say you’ve got balls…’
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I kept my mouth shut and my head down.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to get out of the office before he changed his mind…
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You always tell us to go another round… If I could meet this man, I reckon I could swing it.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was hard to say no to such a powerful man but everything inside me said I should cut and run.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was night-time as I sat in my window seat.  Wow!  I was leaving Australia, going out into the world.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Heaven knows how but I never had the confidence to appear on radio.  I used to go every Saturday night to a children’s show in Adelaide.  I’d sit there with my mother, gaping in awe at the compere, but I couldn’t get up from that seat to go on the air.

Once you knew how to sell something, selling air time or autographed photos was no different.

<BR>
<BR>
[Looking back to 1947.] How glamorous and exciting it was, working in radio.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>

<BR>
[In 2005.] I kept throwing punches until I hit.

I've Got A Secret - Mr Grundy is 80 going on 50.

Reg is a very private man.

<BR>
We're happiest when we are busy.

Reg created a scenario where it's very difficult to say no. He's very unassuming, not a big table thumper.  He's not flash at all. He likes to be the sort of guy who works in the background. He's not a big ‘I am’.  Grundy has never really had an office. He's spent his working life on planes and in hotel rooms trying to close a deal.  
<BR><B>Mike Murphy</B> (Fremantle Media)
<BR>
<BR>
[On Reg Grundy when he finished school.] This boy has ideas and is able to execute them. 
<BR><B>School headmaster</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Reg Grundy.] Reg is one of the most humble and kind people I have ever met.  They say that good guys come last, but nobody told Reg Grundy, because he is an honest and decent man, and a winner.
