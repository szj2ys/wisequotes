I considered abandoning the dream of a public career in Texas and moving to some section of the country where a black woman candidate was less likely to be considered a novelty.  I didn’t want to do this.  I am a Texan; my roots are in Texas.  To leave would be a cop-out.  So I stayed.
<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>

<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In 1974] You, the graduate, will emerge from academia with the expectation, and with the hope, that you will be free to pursue your life as you define it, and you are going to hope that no one will interfere with your definition of your life.  You have a basis for that presumption because there is something in the history of the United States which says that freedom, that liberty, is a part of what we are about.  That history started in 1776…
<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I was at Boston University in this new and strange and different world, and it occurred to me that if I was going to succeed at this strange new adventure, I would have to read longer and more thoroughly than my colleagues at law school had to read.  I felt I had to compensate for what I had missed in earlier years, I would have to work harder, and study longer, than anybody else.
<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In 1962 on winning the vast majority of black votes, but failing to attract the white vote made a win impossible] That was very puzzling to me, and disturbing.  I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what did happen in that race.
<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In 1966 in response to the dangers of focusing on the ‘Black block vote’] Look, don’t tell us about black block votes.  … Our time has come!
<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>

[On complaints that she wasn’t doing enough after soon after being elected in 1966] You don’t get in there having a drink quickly.  You work and you learn the rules and you keep your mouth shut until it is time to open it.
<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On comments that in 1976 Jimmy Carter should be naming her to the vice presidential spot] It’s not my turn.  When it’s my turn, you’ll know.
<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
If this is the best you have to offer, I haven’t missed anything.
<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
If the impeachment provision in the Constitution of the United States will not reach the offenses charged here, then perhaps that eighteenth-century Constitution should be abandoned to a twentieth-century paper shredder.
<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
There are certain legitimate expectations the people have of their government.  There are duties the government must perform on behalf of its people. The reciprocal duties and obligations of the government and its people render the slogan ‘Get the government off our backs’ empty and meaningless. We expect the government to maintain order, security and civility. We expect the government to establish justice and to promote the general welfare. In actualizing those expectations we anticipate that all citizens will be treated fairly. If from time to time circumstances and conditions require suffering, we expect equity in suffering.
<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
A president who faithfully executes the office has a sense of history and a vision for the future. He envisions a society in which all men and women stand on level ground and certain starting places are not favored over others. He sees a society in which all people are free to soar to the upper reaches of their capacities.  He sees unfettered opportunities. He trusts government. He does not fear government.
