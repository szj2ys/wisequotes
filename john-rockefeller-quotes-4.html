<BR>
It has been our policy never to allow a company in which we had an interest to be thrown into the bankruptcy court if we could prevent it; for receiverships are very costly in many ways and often involve heavy sacrifices of genuine values.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Much can be done by careful and patient attention, even when the business is apparently in very deep water.  It requires two things: some added capital, put in by one’s self or secured from others, and a strict adherence to the sound natural laws of business.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Watch the natural operations of trade, and keep within them.  Don’t even think of temporary or sharp advantages.  Don’t waste your effort on a thing which ends in a petty triumph unless you are satisfied with a life of petty success.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Look ahead.  It is surprising how many bright business men go into important undertakings with little or no study of the controlling conditions they risk their all upon.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Study diligently your capital requirements, and fortify yourself to cover possible set-backs, because you can absolutely count on meeting set-backs.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Fortify yourself to cover possible set-backs, because you can absolutely count on meeting set-backs.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Be sure that you are not deceiving yourself at any time about actual conditions.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The man who starts out simply with the idea of getting rich won’t succeed; you must have a larger ambition.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is no mystery in business success.  The great industrial leaders have told again and again the plain and obvious fact that there can be no permanent success without fair dealing that leads to wide spread confidence in the man himself, and that is the real capital we all prize and work for.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is no mystery in business success…  If you do each day’s task successfully, and stay faithfully within these natural operations of commercial laws which I talks so much about, and keep your head clear, you will come out all right.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is hardly necessary to caution a young man… to not lose his head over a little success, or to grow impatient or discouraged by a little failure.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Since 1857 I can remember all the great panics, but I believe the panic of 1907 was the most trying.  No one escaped from it, great or small.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The question has been asked if I think we shall revive quickly from the panic of October, 1907.  I hesitate to speak on the subject, since I am not a prophet nor the son of a prophet; but as to the ultimate outcome there is, of course, no doubt.  This temporary set-back… will not long depress our wonderful spirit of initiative.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A gradual recovery will only tend to make the future all the more secure, and patience is a virtue in business affairs as in other things.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One cannot successfully go against natural tendencies, and it is folly to fail to recognize them.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am sure it is a mistake to assume that the possession of money in great abundance necessarily brings happiness.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The very rich are just like all the rest of us; and if they get pleasure from the possession of money, it comes from their ability to do things which give satisfaction to someone besides themselves.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As I study wealthy men, I can see but one way in which they can secure a real equivalent for money spent, and that is to cultivate a taste for giving where the money may produce an effect which will be a lasting gratification.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The best philanthropy, the help that does the most good and the least harm, the help that nourishes civilization at its very root, that most widely disseminates health, righteousness, and happiness, is not what is usually called charity.  It is… the investment of effort or time or money… to give opportunity for progress and healthful labour where it did not exist before.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It may be urged that the daily vocation of life is one thing, and the work of philanthropy quite another.  I have no sympathy with this notion.

<BR>
Let your first thought be: Where can I fit in so that I may be most effective in the work of the world?  Where can I lend a hand in a way most effectively to advance the general interests?
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The man will be most successful who confers the greatest service on the world.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Commercial enterprises that are not needed fail, and ought to fail.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A business philosopher would be most careful to avoid in his investments of time and effort or money, is the unnecessary duplication of existing industries.  
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Probably the greatest single obstacle to the progress and happiness of the American people lies in the willingness of so many men to invest their time and money in multiplying competitive industries instead of opening up new fields, and putting their money into lines of industry and development that are needed.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It requires a better type of mind to seek out and to support or to create the new than to follow the worn paths of accepted success…
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is a good thing to lead children to realize early the importance of their obligations to others but… it is increasingly difficult; for what were luxuries then have become commonplace now.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It should be a greater pleasure and satisfaction to give money for a good cause than to earn it…
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is one thing to stand on the comfortable ground of placid inaction and put forth words of cynical wisdom, and another to plunge into the work itself and through strenuous experience earn the right to express strong conclusions.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The only thing which is of lasting benefit to a man is that which he does for himself.  Money which comes to him without effort on his part is seldom a benefit and often a course.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The principal objection to speculation – it is not because more lose than gain, though that is true – but it is because those who gain are apt to receive more injury from their success than they would have received from failure.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The forces which conquer sickness are within the body itself, and that it is only when these are reduced below the normal that disease can get a foothold.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The way to ward off disease… is to tone up the body generally; and when disease has secured a foothold, the way to combat it is to help these natural resisting agencies which are in the body already.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The failures which a man makes in his life are due almost always to some defect in his personality, some weakness of body, or mind, or character, will, or temperament.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The only way to overcome these failings is to build up his personality from within, so that he, by virtue of what is within him, may overcome the weakness which was the cause of the failure.  It is only those efforts the man himself puts forth that can really help him.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We all desire to see the widest possible distribution of the blessings of life.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The principal cause for the economic differences between people is their difference in personality…
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is only as we can assist in the wider distribution of those qualities which go to make up a strong personality that we can assist in the wider distribution of wealth.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The man who is strong in body, in mind, in character, and in will need never suffer want.  But these qualities can never be developed in a man unless by his own efforts…
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The man who is strong in body, in mind, in character, and in will need never suffer want.  But these qualities can never be developed in a man unless by his own efforts…The most that any other can do for him is… to help him to help himself.
