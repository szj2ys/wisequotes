Higher prices are themselves inflation and not merely the result of it. They are accelerated and not stopped by taxation... It isn’t high prices that persuade the high cost and marginal producer to make the investment necessary to bring him into production. It is the promise of profit. High prices without profit merely requires more investment to support turnover and inventory.

<BR>
<BR>
There are no such things are incurables, there are only things for which man has not found a cure.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Nobody ever lost money taking a profit.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Many of us listen to these truths and nod our heads at their verity but do nothing to put them into practice.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It has taken some time for the American public to learn there are no short-cuts to world peace.  The task of preventing a third world war will engage us through our whole lives and the lives of our children.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Neither perfection nor utopia are within man’s grasp.  But if the frenzy of soaring hope can never be realized, we can also avoid the panic of plunging despair – if ewe learn to think our problems through, decide what it is that we value most, and organize ourselves – both as individuals and as a nation – to see that first things come first.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The titans who had made vast fortunes had began to give their money away – something they often found more difficult to do wisely than to make it.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[During the war] I quickly learned… that many shortages were really psychological.  Frightened that they might not get what they needed, manufacturers would over buy.  Or thinking that prices were bound to skyrocket, suppliers would hold back their materials.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Planning a successful financial operation was much like planning a military operation.  Before going into action, one had to know both the strengths and the weaknesses of the opposing forces.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One cannot buy the friendship of other nations.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The heavier the burden of taxes, the more difficult it becomes to see that this burden is shared equitably by all segments of the population.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Information cannot serve as an effective substitute for thinking… When World War Two was drawing to a close, many economists and statisticians predicted that the war’s end would throw ten million or more workers out of jobs.  This dire forecast was supported by an impressive array of statistical data…  We saw no large-scale unemployment on the termination of hostilities.  Instead, our report [issued in February 1944] foresaw an unparalleled ‘adventure in prosperity’.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I went further and stated flatly that after the war ended there would be at least five to  seven years of uninterrupted prosperity, no matter what anyone did.  What was that prediction based on?… Mainly my judgment was based on the fact that the war would leave half the world in ruins.  I felt confident that nothing could stop the rebuilding of the world.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is human nature to evade what we cannot cope with.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The passage ahead loom as a perilous one.  But when I think how far we have travelled, I fell confident the difficulties ahead will be overcome.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Edward Harriman had a frail frame but a giant’s energy and imagination.  He was the man I did my best to emulate when I first entered Wall Street.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
At thirty-five I was a seasoned speculator and a millionaire, but I often wished that I had not given up my earlier intention to study medicine.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is one thing to make money and another thing to keep it.  In fact, making money is often easier than keeping it.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is something about inside information which seems to paralyze a man’s reasoning powers.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A man with no special pipeline of information will study the economic facts of a situation and will act coldly on that basis.  Give the same man inside information and he feels himself so much smarter than other people that he will disregard the most evident facts.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nearly all men are controlled by their emotions: they become alternatively over optimistic and over pessimistic.  After you have your facts and opinions, wait for the current.
