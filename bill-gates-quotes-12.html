When I look at what technology is beginning to offer children, I wish I were a kid again.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m not one of those people who hates TV, but I don’t think it exercises your mind much.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m one of those people who thinks kids ought to learn how to multiply with a pencil and a paper even though calculators can do it for them.  But at the same time, I have no doubts that computers can help kids develop more of their mental potential.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Somewhere around two, three, or four is when kids should begin computing.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Computers are a lot like books when they were first utilized.  Initially they are used only by a narrow set of people but to the advantage of everybody – for example, medical researchers.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Both the Bill of Rights and the Internet are potentially fragile.  Mess with either of them too much, and we might ruin them.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I make it a point to read at least one news weekly from cover to cover, because it broadens my interests.  If I only read what intrigues me, such as the science section and a subset of the business section, then I finish the magazine the same person I was before I started.  So I read it all.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Writing a nonfiction book forces you to really think issues through in a disciplined way.  It challenges you to order your thoughts.  You find hidden gaps and inconsistencies, which prompts still more thought.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997] I think in a decade from now, most people will use the Web many times each day.  They will take it for granted, like we use the telephone today.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have to say I feel sorry for the President of the United States, because I get copied on a lot of messages that are sent to him – and I think he probably has a tougher time getting through his e-mail even than I do.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997] My favorite Web site, People Against Poodles.  Everybody is entitled to their opinion.  There’s the poor little dog – cute pooch or ambassador of evil?  And this is a very sophisticated Web site.  Why Pooh-pooh must die.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On whether computers will change newspapers] But it’s like saying, ‘will plays be different after movies?’ or ‘will TV be different?’  I mean, the mediums don’t change just because a new medium comes in.  People like the newspapers today.  They like what they do with it.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1996] When I went to a movie the other night, before the movie, they had one of those ads that they decided to run in advance and one of them had a URL that was about 90 characters long.  And people in the audience were laughing.  I’m not sure why they were laughing  Was it because it was 90 characters long, or it just appeared so foreign with all those dots and slashes and everything?  But you know, it was better than the movie that came afterward.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It has not, nor has it ever been, the intention of my company to turn the information superhighway into a toll road.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998] The beauty of the Internet is its openness.  It cannot be controlled or dominated or cut off, because it is simply a constantly changing series of linkages.  It is such a creative, living medium that no one yet fully comprehends its opportunities.  
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The United States has been the country that has embraced computer technology more rapidly than any other country, and it’s no coincidence that the U.S. economy has benefited from that and created more jobs than any other economy.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Today if you had to guess somebody’s approximate income and you were limited to asking one polite question, a good one would be: ‘What country do you live in?’  That’s because of the huge disparities in average wages from country to country.  But a generation from now, if you want o guess someone’s income, a more telling single question might be: ‘What’s your education?’
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The world of business is moving faster and faster and it’s increasingly global.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1994 on being asked when they would see a female Bill Gates] Well, nobody can predict these things.  I mean, I didn’t predict my success; how can I predict anyone else’s?  But high tech will involve more women because it is becoming more consumer-oriented and because it’s a growth business that really needs to reach out to a broad set of talents.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m always fascinated by the question of whether the most talented people end up in critical positions – in politics, business, academia, or the military.  It’s amazing the way some people develop during their lives.

<BR>
When the day comes that a computer is chess champion, the milestone won’t really be all that meaningful.  It shouldn’t offend human dignity any more than the realization that a person with binoculars can see distant objects better than a person without binoculars.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Playing chess can help a person how to apply strategy in other games or situations and possibly even succeed in business, but playing chess can’t teach a computer anything.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t think there’s anything unique about human intelligence.  All the neurons in the brain that make up perceptions and emotions operate in a binary fashion.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Evolution is many orders of magnitude ahead of mankind today in creating a complex system.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Leonardo da Vinci] Leonardo was one of the most amazing people who ever lived.  He was a genius in more fields than any scientist of any age, and an astonishing painter and sculptor.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In terms of allocation of time resources, religion is not very efficient.  There’s a lot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being asked if he’d been lucky given his great success] No, my success just proves that life is chaotic… Some butterfly did the right thing for me.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m a big believer in religious values.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have the freedom to do whatever I want.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997] Microsoft won’t be immortal.  All companies fail.  It’s just a question of when.  My goal is to keep my company vital as long as possible, of course.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On running Microsoft] I can’t think of being 60 and running the company.  By then I will pick a new CEO.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Even after 20 years, I still think I have the best job in the world.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A lot of people like the idea of having a job that helps change the world in a positive way, and I have that satisfaction.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I never got to spend a decade thinking about economics.  I never got to be biochemist.  I never scored 72 in a game of golf and it’s unlikely I ever will, though I hold out a faint hope (my best score is 87).
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A disease for which there is no effective therapy is an unsolved mystery.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t waste time ruing the past.  I made my decision, and the way to do it best is, once you make it, you just don’t waver at all.  You don’t think, gosh, what a doctor I would’ve been, what a tennis player, playboy, poker player I couldn’t been.  Being hardcore and forward looking about what you do is a necessary element of doing it well.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Paul Allen] We like to talk about how the fantasies we had as kids and the neat things we dreamed about – actually came true.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Science fiction suggests that someday hundreds of people will fill a huge starship and spend generations traveling to a star.  For example, the great grandchildren of the original voyagers might complete the trip.  Maybe so, but I’m not getting on that ship!  I’m sticking here.  We have lakes.  We have rivers.  We have mountains.  Earth is amazing compared to what’s available in the surrounding few light-years.  
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What if Columbus had been told, ‘Chris, baby, don’t go now.  Wait until we’ve solved our number-one priorities – war and famine, poverty and crime, pollution and disease, illiteracy and racial hatred…
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997] It’s possible, you can never know, that the universe exists only for me.  If so, it’s going well for me, I must admit.
