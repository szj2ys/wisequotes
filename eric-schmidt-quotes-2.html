<p>200 Eric Schmidt Quotes</p><p><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="eric-schmidt-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="eric-schmidt-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="eric-schmidt-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="eric-schmidt-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="4347677141";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Our rate of innovation is significantly faster than anyone in the industry and significantly faster than our competitors, the secret here is not the way we manage but in our selection of the people.  This model works when you have the right people. It would be a complete failure in an organization of people who wanted to be told what to do and had one big project. We try to have as little middle management as possible. They get in the way.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> We have decided not to give that information out.  We don't want our competitors to learn it. We have invented models they don't have, which is one of the things that is driving things so quickly from a revenue perspective.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Google News is a very successful product for us. Every month or two we have this conversation.  Google News is easily monetizeable and would make lots of money. The team comes in and asks, 'Do you want more revenue or do you want Arabic news?' That seems like a no-brainer. We want Arabic news. There are only about 300 countries. Eventually we will run out of this and then we will work on monetization.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR>  [On being asked what social impact Google's gathering and dissemination of the world's information would have, Schmidt took a breather.] We don't know. I personally believe the right model is to think of all the world's information in the equivalent of an iPod. What happens when you are carrying all that information with you and there is a real-time update? What does it do to teaching when every student can do the answer quicker than any professor can get it out of his or her mouth?<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Our business has relatively little lock-in.  It means our competitiveness is search by search, person by person. We understand that and talk about that a lot. We have to be better on every search in every language, everywhere in the world<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR>  [On being caught in the cross fire of government regulators like Microsoft] It is a problem to worry about.  We are a big enough force now that people pay a lot of attention to us. We are creating some negative waves for people who are disenfranchised or unhappy or don't want us for some other reason. I think it is going to get worse as we become more and more of the fabric of the online experience<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> We have built and are in the process of building what we call proprietary content distribution.  The vast majority of the money goes to the content provider. We keep a fee for providing the billing relationship.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Google is likely to be, if not the, one of the largest places people come from, from the standpoint of being an information publisher. So you will want to work with us. We hope we would be the largest traffic generator to you as a publisher. We think that is good.  <BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> The advertising network is a beautiful thing to behold.  We have a wonderfully diverse set of advertisers. We're not reliant on any particular category or advertiser to some overwhelming regard.  <BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Part of it is because of this concept called 'The Long Tail’.  The surprising thing about The Long Tail is how long the long part of the tail really is, and how many small businesses there are that have not [had access to] the mass market.  We're doing pretty well in the middle of the tail. We still do not have all the products and services that in our judgment are really needed to serve the largest advertisers, or the very tiniest of advertisers. We want to make sure we serve this whole space very, very well, and that is all stuff under development   <BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>We are not quite as unconventional as we actually say all the time.  The things that we do are unique in the way that products are created, but much of the rest of the business is run in all the normal ways and very much at the state-of-the art but in a traditional way. We actually do care about objectives. Every quarter we go through, 'How are we doing?’<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> You have to work on your core business because that is the thing that brings in the cash flow, the customers, the business.  We have a very sophisticated set of product managers and technology leaders who understand how to take some of these brilliant ideas and turn them into businesses.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> We concluded that although we weren't wild about the restrictions, it was even worse to not try to serve those users at all. We actually did an 'evil scale.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> We have figured out ways to stay focused on end users and innovation.  We're very excited about the talent we have assembled, the scale that we operate in, the computing power of the technology that we have built here, and all of the innovation<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> When you look at the Amazon and you say, 'Why aren't there any Internet users?' it's because there is no power.  And people are working on this. So we'll get them all, even the people in the trees. It's just a matter of getting them power and some kind of a device.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> We spent half the time talking about personal matters, then half the time on his perception that Google had stolen Apple’s user interface designs.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Steve [Jobs] has a particular way that he wants to run Apple, and it’s the same as it was twenty years ago, which is that Apple is a brilliant innovator of closed systems.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> [Apple] They don’t want people to be on their platform without permission.  The benefits of a closed platform is control.  But Google has a specific belief that open is the better approach, because it leads to more options and competition and consumer choice.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> The most remarkable technological innovations occur when small teams of people are free to explore the outer limits of their imaginations.  <BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Observers are often surprised by how much autonomy the various groups at Microsoft have.  It’s very much a bottom up culture.  <BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>[On bottom up culture] All of the successful high tech companies have had to adopt this model except the chip companies.  They’re different because chips have really long lead times, are so complicated, and require so many people.  <BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> In the tech industry, especially software, it’s possible and desirable to be decentralized.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> You need to let the artists explore and create the next great thing, which they will do reliably if you permit it. <BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> All of us who manage talented, idiosyncratic people know there’s art involved.  We routinely support exploration for which we, as managers, don’t immediately see the point because… great ideas emerge.  You can’t get to them by taking the most direct route because you don’t know the destination in advance.  You think you’re working on one thing, but the really important thing turns out to be something else entirely, something on the periphery of what you thought was important.  I’ve seen this happen again and again.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Java was originally thought of as a technology with relatively limited scope, useful in TV set-top boxes that sort of thing.  …we at Sun, came around to the realization that the Internet and Java combined in a way that would create a tectonic shift in the technology landscape, one that could greatly benefit the company’s bottom line.  <BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> [At Novell] We originally thought the ZENworks project was about one thing but it turned out to be about something much different, and much more important.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> When I arrived at Google, I discovered that the founders, Sergey (Brin) and Larry (Page), had a great appreciation for letting the artists work (and play), and for the emergent character of important innovations.  They had established the kind of management style and culture at Google that nurtures artful exploration and innovation, and I’m doing my best to keep that alive.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> The management methods you use when you rely on emergent innovations can seem pretty foreign to people who have been steeped in the methods of industrial-age companies.  But in the high-tech world (and probably in many other industries), being able to manage creative engineers so that they will produce emergent innovations is absolutely critical.  <BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> The environment is changing so fast that it requires improvisation in terms of strategy, products, and even day-to-day operations.  Just when you think you understand the technology landscape, you see a major disruption.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> The reason high tech is so hard to follow is that disruptions come without warning.  Just like our major innovations, disruptions come from the corner of your business model where you’re not expecting them.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>One company’s innovation is another’s disruption.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Java was an innovation for Sun but a disruption for its competitors.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> How you prepare yourself for unexpected shifts will determine how you’ll do in the long run in high-tech or any business where uncertainty reigns.  …this will be increasingly true in many less knowledge-work-oriented industries.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> We often organize our people into what we call ‘Googlets’, - teams of three or four engineers who are seen on missions of exploration and innovation.  What Googlets come back with is often unexpected, but just as often exciting and profitable.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> There’s little doubt in my mind that our Googlets are engaged in collaborative art.  I’ve sometimes argued that, in fact, it goes beyond art – that it’s nothing short of magic.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> They [Austin and Devlin] debunk the myth that this magic is unreliable.  It’s not.  It has a structure.  It is rigorous.  And it is reliable – as long as you furnish an environment in which your people can do it and keep creating it.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> I believe that human values ultimately win out over mechanistic values or technology for its own sake in an increasingly technological world.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Companies, especially high-techs, are not machines.  They are collections of tremendously motivated and creative people, and it is their intrinsic motivation and their creativity that makes all the difference.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> We agreed the month before we went public that we should work together for 20 years.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> Don’t fight the internet.<BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">Eric Schmidt<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="eric-schmidt-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="eric-schmidt-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="eric-schmidt-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="eric-schmidt-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="eric-schmidt-quotes-5.html">5<a/> </p><p><BR>
