[On cornering Northwest stock] The stock was selling at 75 to 80.  I considered it very cheap and bought.

[On him being thrifty and an uptown harness dealer not being able to sell him new harness ‘Mr Gould was a regular customer for small articles.  He seldom bought a new harness, preferring instead to have his old ones patched up from year to year.  He is the only millionaire I ever saw who did not care about showy trappings for his horses.  I could never persuade him to try the new fads.  Once he called for a harness I had been repairing.  I showed him how nicely the work had been done, and said incidentally it was as good as new.  Before he left I tried to sell him another harness.’] No, wrap up my old harness and I will take it home.  You say it is as good as new, so I can’t waste money by buying still another brand new set.  I could not use two new harnesses if I had them.

[The minister of Joy Gould’s church asked the railroad tycoon where he might invest his life savings of $30,000.  Gould recommended the stock of the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and, sworn to secrecy, the minister followed his advice.  When the stock’s price lost most of its value, Gould reimbursed the minister for his losses, whereupon the contrite clergyman confessed to Gould that he had passed the tip along to several other members of the congregation.  Then Gould said] Oh, I assumed you would.  They were the ones I was after.

People will deal in chance.

[At the age of 14 in 1850] As I was a boy of the family I generally brought the cows in the morning and assisted my sisters to milk them and drove them back, and went for them again at night.  I went barefooted and I used to get thistles in my feet, and I did not like farming in that way; so I said one day to my father that I would like to go to a select school that was some twelve or fifteen miles from there.  He said all right, but that I was too young.  I said to him that if he would give me my time I would try my fortune.  He said, all right; that I was not worth much at home and I might go ahead.  So next day I started off.  I showed myself up at the school, and finally I found a blacksmith who consented to board me, as I wrote a pretty good hand, if I could write up his books at night.  In that way I worked myself through this school.
<BR><a href="jay-gould-quotes.html">Jay Gould<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think I was about fourteen when I left home, and I spent about a year at school.  Then I got into a country store, where I made myself useful, sweeping it out every morning and learning what I could about the business during the day.  My duties in the store occupied me from 6 o’clock in the morning until 10 o’clock at night.  In the meantime I had got quite a taste for mathematics, especially surveying and engineering.
<BR><a href="jay-gould-quotes.html">Jay Gould<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I then made up my mind to ago ahead.
<BR><a href="jay-gould-quotes.html">Jay Gould<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I got through with the summer’s work my employer had failed and was unable to pay me.  There were two other young men, wealthy men’s sons, who had been engaged on the same work, and we three together had the control of it.  I proposed to them that we should go on and finish the map ourselves, and finally we decided to do so.  Then, as they lived in the county and were pretty conspicuous, they wanted to put their names to the map, so I said to them, ‘Very well; I will sell you out my interest,’ and I sold out my interest to them for $500.  That was the result of my first summer’s work.
<BR><a href="jay-gould-quotes.html">Jay Gould<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I had made up my mind that I would go it alone, and I made those surveys alone and completed them, and they were very successful in sale, so that I made about $5,000 out of those maps.
<BR><a href="jay-gould-quotes.html">Jay Gould<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The panic of 1857 came… I thought once or twice that we would fail, but we went through…
<BR><a href="jay-gould-quotes.html">Jay Gould<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On a mouse trap in 1853 at the age of 17] I was ambitious and had brought a little thing with me which I was sure was to make my fortune and revolutionize the world.
<BR><a href="jay-gould-quotes.html">Jay Gould<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The panic of 1857 came on and everything was very much disturbed.  Railroad values after this time went down very low and the first mortgage bonds of the Rutland and Washington Railroad were selling at 10 cents on the dollar.  I bought all the bonds at that price, borrowing the money to pay for them.  I took the entire charge of this road and learned the business, as I may say.  I was President, Secretary, Treasurer and Superintendent, had sole control…
<BR><a href="jay-gould-quotes.html">Jay Gould<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A friend of mine came to me one night and said that the next day he must fail.  He had bought Cleveland and Pittsburg, but could not pay for it.  He bought it at 60 and it was down to about 40.  I told him, ‘I will take half of what you have at that figure.’  He agreed to this, and that was the way I became the owner of the Cleveland and Pittsburg.  As soon as it was found that there was some one there who could take care of it the stock went up to 120.  I took the road and it was very successful.  It paid dividends from the start, and finally I sold it to the Pennsylvania road.
<BR><a href="jay-gould-quotes.html">Jay Gould<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On defending Wall Street] People will deal in chance.  Your minister, doctor and barber all have the same interest in speculation.  Would you not, if you stopped it, promote gambling?
<BR><a href="jay-gould-quotes.html">Jay Gould<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Make money – honestly, if you can – but make it.  
<BR><a href="jay-gould-quotes.html">Jay Gould<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In a Republican district I was a strong Republican; in a Democratic district I was Democratic, and in doubtful districts I was doubtful.  In politics I was an Erie Railroad man all the time.  We had friends on both sides – friends in a business way.
<BR><a href="jay-gould-quotes.html">Jay Gould<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On a son of his wanting to marry an actress] I am pleased that you have selected a respectable woman who is able to earn her own living.
