With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called entangling.  From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporising ground.  In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.  Should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up. If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.  These six are the principles connected with Earth.  The general who has attained a responsible post must becareful to study them.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Know an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: 1) Flight; 2) in subordination; 3) collapse; 4) ruin; (5) disorganisation; 6) rout.  <BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled  against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is insubordination.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When   the   higher  officers   are   angry  and  insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own   account   from   a   feeling  of resentment,   before   the commander-in-chief can  tell whether or no he is  in a position to fight, the result is ruin.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganisation.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls  a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be a rout.  These are six ways of courting defeat: which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the lest of a great general.  He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge  into practice,  will win his  battles.  He who knows them not, nor practises them, will surely be defeated.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must light, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.  If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make, your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your  commands;   and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.  Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.  Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The art of war recognises nine varieties of ground: 1) Dispersive ground; 2) facile ground; 3) contentious ground; 4) open ground; 5) ground of intersecting highways; 6) serious ground; 7) difficult ground; 8) hemmed-in ground; 9) desperate ground.  When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.  When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground.  Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground.  Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.  Ground which forms the key to three contiguous slates, so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is ground of intersecting highways.  When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.  Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens - all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.  Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed-in ground.  Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way. On ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>On serious ground, gather in plunder.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>On desperate ground, fight.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Those who were called skilful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When the enemy's men were scattered, they prevented them from concentrating; even when their forces were united, they managed to keep them in disorder.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: "Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will."<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Rapidity is the essence of war. Take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength. Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in the heart of a hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.  Thus, without waiting to be marshalled, the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive [Be on the alert or lookout]; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks.  But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The skilful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan.  Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the Ch'ang mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.  Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan, I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.  Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-7.html">7<a/> </p><p><BR>
