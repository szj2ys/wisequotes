<BR>
You’re f*cking 21, for f*ck’s sake!  You should be getting 12 f*cking hard-ons a day.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2005] My life has been an incredible rollercoaster ride.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his childhood.] We didn’t have a lot of money, so it was a very hard upbringing with very limited food on the table.  We never sat down to a starter, main course and pudding and we had to eat everything we were given.  There was no such thing as ‘don’t like’ in our family.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father.] At one point he sold the family car to pay for a ticket to Texas, where he had planned to spend three months playing with a band.  The first everyone else in the family knew what he had done was when the finance company turned up to collect the keys.  You just don’t forget those kinds of situations.  Mum struggling to pay the bills and putting up with all this sh*t.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his mother and domestic violence.] The reason she seemed so weak was because she was defending our arses.  You have to admire the loyalty of a woman who puts her children first.  And that’s where I get my determination from.  From her, without a doubt.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was naturally aggressive…
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Glascow Rangers and himself at the age of 16.] Even if they didn’t like my game, they must have still liked my attitude.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was a pretty determined player…
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On regular sporting injuries.] So many things go through your mind, your confidence is wiped out and you become paranoid.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being told to drop down from Glasgow Rangers from a year with the sporting injuries.] I took the failure very, very badly, like any 18 year old would.  I couldn’t move on and I wanted to forget about it.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I had to let go of what I loved first, and that was hard.  I’d been so close.  And I felt so bitter for so long.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I dropped football like a f*cking lead balloon…
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Dad had also stopped paying the mortgage, so the building society repossessed the house – the home of her own that my mother had longed for all her life.  She was humiliated again, and her dream was shattered.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had six weeks of being a waiter, which was a disaster.  I only lasted four days working the tables and spent the rest of the time in the kitchen.  And I loved it.  I loved it instantly, big time.  The boisterousness, the hassle, the shouting, the screaming, the activity.  I found a sense of freedom there.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve got to get it right.  I was obsessed with never again being told that I’m not good enough.  I had failed once in life.  I swore I would never fail at anything ever again.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If I can’t have a FA Cup winner’s medal, I want a third Michelin star.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was one thing to tell his mates that his son was playing for Rangers, but quite another to say I was training to be a cook.  ‘Stay away from catering,’ he said to me at one point.  ‘It’s girly and effeminate.’  I don’t think he ever really forgave me when I ignored him.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the restaurant business.] I had no idea I was going to be good at it but I loved it from day one.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe that, if you want to be the best, then you have to work for the best.  If you do, there’s no automatic assumption that you will make it.  But that’s where you have to start.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The most important thing for a chef is that you’ve got to be able to take a bollocking.  The trick is to remember that none of the insults is meant to be personal.
