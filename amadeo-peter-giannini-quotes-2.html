[On passing way in 1949 he left an estate of $480,000 – Dividing $9,000 to non-immediate relatives/children and $471,000 to charities.  He was very close to his two surviving children] I believe in using money to help worthy causes while one is still living, and thus get some fun out of it.  Of course, it is every man’s duty to strive to give his children the best possible equipment for life.  But to leave millions to young sons is dangerous.  Each of us is better for having to make our own way in the world.  God meant us to work.  Those who don’t work never amount to anything.  To take from anyone the incentive to work is a questionable service.

<BR>
If my opponents hadn’t forced me time after time, there would have been no driving, sustained effort to top the field.

There is no fun in working merely for money.  I like to do things, to be a builder.  The upbuilding of the Bank of Italy and its various associated institutions has been tremendously fascinating.

<BR>

I long since mastered the knack of thinking on whatever subject was in my mind whenever any one started and kept on talking about something of no interest to me.  I can let such a conversation go in at one ear and out at the other without ever interfering with my own mental machinery.

<BR>
[In 1930] The little fellow is the best customer that a bank can have, because he is with you.  He starts in with you and stays to the end.  Whereas the big fellow is only with you so long as he can get something out of you; and when he cannot, he is not for you anymore.
<BR><a href="amadeo-peter-giannini-quotes.html">Amadeo Peter Giannini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1930 on nationwide banking coming just as department stores and drug stores did] It is coming gentlemen, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.

<BR>
<BR>
[On discovering a common bank practice around 1900 of one of a Columbus Saving director accepting commissions for arranging loans through the bank and also selling fire insurance to bank customers and keeping the premiums for himself.  He confronted the bank board of which he had recently joined that they should fire this director due to integrity/conflict of interest.  But they refused.] I might never have gone into the banking game if I hadn’t got so damn mad at those Columbus directors.

<BR>
[On an earthquake in San Francisco in April 1906 that had broken a gas mains and the city being engulfed in flames and one banker in the aftermath proposing that there should be a moratorium for six months on all lending] Gentlemen, you are making a vital mistake.  If you keep your banks closed until November, you might as well never open them, for there will be no city left.  The time for doing business is right now.
<BR><a href="amadeo-peter-giannini-quotes.html">Amadeo Peter Giannini<a/>

<BR>
A banker should consider himself a servant of the people, a servant of the community.  This is my role; this is me and what I want to do; and I am convinced I can do it.

[On seeing his future wife Clorinda singing in the choir and deciding at that point he] Made up his mind that he would never marry any other woman.

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On courting for six months before marrying his future wife Clorinda in 1892] My courting days were a strenuous affair.  I used to dress up mighty fancy and have never dressed up as fancy since.  Many a time I went home after leaving her after a dance and changed to go to work – in those days we worse black formal clothes, long tails and all.  But she was engaged to a doctor who was in Europe, and the big job I had then was to get her away from him.

When election time came around next time we were remembered.  When you sell people keep them sold.  That applies to politics as well as business.

<BR>
[In 1928 on not wasting money] I don’t want any more money.  If I had all the millions in the world, I couldn’t live better than I do.  I enjoy work.  What is called high society doesn’t mean anything to me.  I’ve always said I would never be a millionaire.  Maybe this will convince some of the skeptics that I mean what I mean what I say.
<BR><a href="amadeo-peter-giannini-quotes.html">Amadeo Peter Giannini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1945 he felt that he was] In danger of getting into the millionaire class… I’ve always vowed I’d never become a millionaire.

<BR>
[In 1932 on returning from retirement at age 61 to wrest control of the huge holding corporation which he originally created from the men to whom he relinquished the management two years prior] This is all part of their plan to get price down and buy in so as to wrest control from the old crowd… This sort of stuff will mean the old crowd will stampede out and the new crowd will come into control.  
<BR><a href="amadeo-peter-giannini-quotes.html">Amadeo Peter Giannini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To his son in 1932 on returning from retirement at age 61 to wrest control of the huge holding corporation which he originally created from the men to whom he relinquished the management two years prior] Don’t let them ruffle you or get your goat.  Maintain dignity keep cool and keep yourself in shape.  Above all remember ours was institution with soul working solely for the interest of stockholders.  Its right and principle we are battling for and there’s no compromise with right or principle regardless of consequences.  No sir, never my boy.

[On his politics interlude to remove a corrupt government, by helping James Phelan at around the age of 29] I got into politics because of a desire to help Phelan.  It was a diversion.  I had lots of energy and this gave me an outlet.

<BR>
<BR>
[In 1927 at the age of 57 on being involved in politics whilst running the Bank of America] That’s a lie.  I am not in politics, never have been and don’t expect to be.  Whoever says I am is a liar.

[In 1936 when he had announced retirement at least twice before] I’ll stand on the sidelines in a fatherly sort of watchfulness, the family watchdog ready to growl at any sign of danger from without and ready to bark at you if I find any turning away from the ideas on which the institution [Bank of America] was founded.
<BR><a href="amadeo-peter-giannini-quotes.html">Amadeo Peter Giannini<a/>

The women are crazy about him [he kissed their hands, Continental fashion], and he gives a man in overalls as much attention as a big depositor.

<BR><a href="amadeo-peter-giannini-quotes.html">Amadeo Peter Giannini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On all the loan requests in 1907 after the fire] Look at all these requests we have.  If we give everybody all he wants there won’t be enough money to go ‘round.  You raise half the money and we’ll supply the other half.
<BR><a href="amadeo-peter-giannini-quotes.html">Amadeo Peter Giannini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On often fishing out a five dollar gold piece from his pocket if the father of a new baby was a poor man] For the little fellow; and remember that a savings account in his name can be started with a dollar.

<BR><a href="amadeo-peter-giannini-quotes.html">Amadeo Peter Giannini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

(He last retired from the bank at age 75)]  I have deemed it but fair… to afford you timely notice that under no condition will I accept the position of director or officer of the bank at the next annual meeting of the stockholders.

[On the Bank of America’s (Originally called Bank of Italy) Los Angeles branch being profitable]  The foregoing remarks have been prompted by certain criticism heretofore made by several local directors and officers of the Bank… to the effect that the establishment of a branch of the Bank of Italy in Los Angeles was now considered a mistake; that it was not paying, and that it was about to be closed down… On January 1st 1914 the deposits of said branch amounted to $2,400,000.00 which deposits have since suffered a shrinkage of about $500,000.00.  Said branch is at present, nevertheless, earning from $3,500.00 to $4,000.00 per month, net, of which about $1,500.00 is to be attributed to profits on moneys furnished it by the head office, and about $2,000.00 per month net is being realized by it on its present deposits…

<BR>
<BR>
[In 1917] No one could have foreseen the enormous increase in spring planting that followed the declaration of war… The resulting crops that have been harvested this fall in the district tributary to San Francisco give sensational evidence of what can be accomplished in the future… The bean growers increased their 1916 output by over 75% leaping from 4,175,000 bushels to 7,500,000.  Barley advanced from 23,420,000 bushels to 35,206,000.  These two crops were real thrillers.
