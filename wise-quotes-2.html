Five to ten years of wise debt buys you a lifetime of debt-free existence.
<BR><a href="robert-g-allen-quotes.html">Robert G Allen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As one wise man put it, ‘One small good deed is better than a grand intention.’
<BR><a href="robert-g-allen-quotes.html">Robert G Allen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We read a lot. I don’t know anyone who’s wise who doesn’t read a lot. But that’s not enough: You have a to have a temperament to grab ideas and do sensible things. Most people don’t grab the right ideas or don’t know what to do with them.
<BR><a href="charlie-munger-quotes.html">Charlie Munger<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[A young shareholder asked Charlie how to follow in his footsteps, and Charlie brought down the house by saying.] We get these questions a lot from the enterprising young. It’s a very intelligent question: You look at some old guy who’s rich and you ask, ‘How can I become like you, except faster?’ Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts… slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day – if you live long enough – most people get what they deserve.
<BR><a href="charlie-munger-quotes.html">Charlie Munger<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The best way to get a good spouse is to deserve a good spouse.

He who is virtuous is wise; and he who is wise is good; and he who is good is happy.
<BR><a href="zig-ziglar-quotes.html">Zig Ziglar<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
You can get everything you want in life you want, if you help enough other people get what they want.
<BR><a href="zig-ziglar-quotes.html">Zig Ziglar<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Wise is he who offers the hand of reconciliation should a difference with a friend arise. Unhappy he to the end of his days who refuses it.
<BR><a href="andrew-carnegie-quotes.html">Andrew Carnegie<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

Know your own mind and you will be as wise as the sages. 
<BR><a href="napoleon-hill-quotes.html">Napoleon Hill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes it is wiser to join forces with an opponent than it is to fight him.
<BR><a href="napoleon-hill-quotes.html">Napoleon Hill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The wise investor can profit if he can think independently of the crowd and reach the rich answer when the majority of financial opinion is leaning the other way.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1885] I do not recall any one who thought that the internal combustion engine could ever have more than a limited use. All the wise people demonstrated conclusively that the engine could not compete with steam.
<BR><a href="henry-ford-quotes.html">Henry Ford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Concentrate your energies, your thoughts and your capital… The wise man puts all his eggs in one basket and watches the basket.
<BR><a href="andrew-carnegie-quotes.html">Andrew Carnegie<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I dared where the wise ones feared to tread.
<BR><a href="king-gillette-quotes.html">King Gillette<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Today I will pluck grapes of wisdom from the tallest and fullest vines in the vineyard, for these were planted by the wisest of my profession who have come before me, generation upon generation.
<BR><a href="og-mandino-quotes.html">Og Mandino<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Beginning today, treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight. Extend to them all the care, kindness, and understanding you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again.
<BR><a href="og-mandino-quotes.html">Og Mandino<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

Keep in mind the wise words of Lucien Hooper, a Wall Street legend: “What always impresses me,” he wrote, “is how much better the relaxed, long-term owners of stock do with their portfolios than the traders do with their switching of inventory. The relaxed investor is usually better informed and more understanding of essential values; he is more patient and less emotional; he pays smaller capital gains taxes; he does not incur unnecessary brokerage commissions; and he avoids behaving like Cassius by ‘thinking too much.’”
<BR><a href="john-templeton-quotes.html">John Templeton<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
You’d be wise to have multiple streams of income flowing into your life.
<BR><a href="robert-g-allen-quotes.html">Robert G Allen<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We are wise because we follow nature as the best of guides, and obey her as a goddess.

<BR>
Change from the habit of fault-finding to the habit of looking for the good in other people and letting them know you have discovered it. People will see in you whatever you see in them, be it good or bad.
<BR><a href="napoleon-hill-quotes.html">Napoleon Hill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
No-one will take as much care with your money as you will yourself.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Investment expertise can never be bought or hired. Anyone possessing such skill will use it on his own behalf for the maximum personal gain, and will not on behalf of a host of ungrateful strangers for a pittance of a salary.
<BR><a href="bob-jones-quotes.html">Bob Jones<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Words are ‘bread for the head’.
<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

It’s not what happens in the world that determines the major part of your future. What happens, happens to us all. The key is what you do about it.
<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.
<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You cannot change your destination overnight, but you can change your direction overnight.
<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You are what you read.
<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Formal education will make you a living. Self-education will make you a fortune.
<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People are not lazy. They simply have impotent goals – that is, goals that do not inspire them.
<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the question he asked personally to the Dalai Llama] The question was ‘How do you get rid of bad karma?’… His response to me was ‘The way you get rid of bad karma, is you create just good karma.’ So you inherit bad karma from perhaps a past life or something you’re done that’s been bad over a long period of time. But you can negate or neutralise it just by you can creating good things around you by doing good deeds and thinking good thoughts.
<BR><a href="mark-bouris-quotes.html">Mark Bouris<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Investment success cannot be captured in a mathematical equation or a computer program.
<BR><a href="seth-klarman-quotes.html">Seth Klarman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

We don’t get paid for being busy, we get paid for being right.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The future is never clear. You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus. Uncertainty is the friend of the buyer of long-term values.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It takes a lifetime to build a reputation and a five minutes to ruin it.

<BR>
<BR>
The only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune tellers look good.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The sign above the players’ entrance to the field at Notre Dame reads ‘Play like a champion today’. I sometimes joke that the sign at Nebraska reads ‘Remember your helmet’. Charlie and I are ‘Remember your helmet’ kind of guys. We like to keep it simple.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You do not get rich at work. You get rich by doing your homework.
<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you are afraid of making mistakes, you will not want to do anything.
<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Think like a dairy farmer (cashflow), not like a cattle rancher (capital gains).
