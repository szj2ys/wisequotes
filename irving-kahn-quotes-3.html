<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If a company has great prospects everyone already knows about it.  We won’t be comfortable paying for good prospects.
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>

Warren Buffett wanted a job with Ben [Graham] but Ben wouldn’t give him a job, and he said that it wasn’t because of a lack of experience but that he tended to favor boys that were Jewish because they were so often discriminated against.  But later, he changed his mind about that and gave a job to Warren anyway.
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Ben’s [Graham] best book is not the book he’s known best for [The Intelligent Investor].  His best book, his most important book, was ‘Storage and Stability.’
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Benjamin Graham remains the father of investment analysis for both elementary and advanced pupils.
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Recognizing the need to bring his approach to the attention of the astute laymen, Ben [Graham] in 1949 wrote ‘The Intelligent Investor’.
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Benjamin Graham] A very fair mind, entirely objective, in distinguishing between what was fair rather than what was self-serving.
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Benjamin Graham] He had a wonderful personality and could make friends with anybody.  But he was such a workaholic he didn’t have much of a social life.
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Ben [Graham] didn’t need any gilding.  He had a lot of gold in him.

<BR>
<BR>
[Ben Graham] He used the Harvard case system.  Ben never asked you to believe what he said unless there were concrete examples to support what he said.
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On describing Benjamin Graham’s personality] A need colleague would always be helped – but always anonymously.  He loved to make others laugh by means of his quick wit and large inventory of puns.  Everyone that ever had dealings with Ben came away with certain strong reactions.  These included the uplift that comes from someone who shares your enthusiasms and hopes, as well as the strong sense of a very fair mind, entirely objective, in distinguishing between what was fair rather than what was self-serving.

<BR>
[On how Wall Street has changed in 2011] When I got to the street in [19]28/29 it was much more a rich mans game.  Not that I was rich… It’s not longer a rich man’s business.  It’s a business for everybody.
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On watching the stock market every day] I don’t watch it, because I’m not a trader.     
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I stick to the 20 odd stocks that I hold.  
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On whether he has a cellular mobile phone at age 106]  Yes I do.  I don’t use it much except to remind myself what my number is.  
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>

<BR>
Do you own homework and don’t believe in the newspapers.
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We want to grow our money but not necessarily in growth stocks.
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>

[At age 104] The important thing is to keep that brain going you see.
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At age 104] I read a lot of science.  I read no fiction and no mystery stories and no sex novels.  So that leaves a lot of time for science.    
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At age 106] People are always worried about the economy and the world, especially since the financial crisis of 2008 and Europe’s sovereign debt crisis in 2011.  I feel that people should learn to be optimistic because life goes on, and sometimes favorable surprises come out of the blue, whether due to new policies or scientific breakthroughs.
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At age 106] The world is full of complications, and the media are full of advertising.  Stop buying things that you don’t need, and start focusing on the essentials; then you will live long and be happy.  In life, the goal is to achieve happiness, so start thinking about the things that count!
<BR><a href="irving-kahn-quotes.html">Irving Kahn<a/>
