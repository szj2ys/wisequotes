<BR><a href="james-goldsmith-quotes.html">James Goldsmith<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Dynamism is usually the result of disequilibrium.  My disequilibrium comes from the very fact that I’m a foreigner… I’m a Jew to the Catholics, a Catholic to the Jews, an Englishman to the French, and a Frenchman to the English.

<BR>
<BR>
You learn effectively by trying things.
<BR><a href="james-goldsmith-quotes.html">James Goldsmith<a/>
<BR>

[On his initial business ideas.] As you tested the ideas - if you have a sense of survival, you change them if they turn out to be wrong.
<BR><a href="james-goldsmith-quotes.html">James Goldsmith<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Due to not being able to adapt their ideas in a changing environment.] Professors are structurally bound to be wrong.  
<BR><a href="james-goldsmith-quotes.html">James Goldsmith<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If I had been teaching as opposed to running a business, I would have come in with a set of ideas, and I was sufficiently persuasive to get good people to adopt those ideas.  And when it turned out that all those ideas were wrong – you change them.  
<BR><a href="james-goldsmith-quotes.html">James Goldsmith<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If I had of been a teacher, if I’d been in business school I would have stuck to the same ideas all my life.  I would have been teaching total nonsense all my life.

<BR><a href="james-goldsmith-quotes.html">James Goldsmith<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="james-goldsmith-quotes.html">James Goldsmith<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You should be learning theory but testing it constantly.
<BR><a href="james-goldsmith-quotes.html">James Goldsmith<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s a constant learning process…
