<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>

Well, my greatest reward, I think, is that I’ve been able to build this wonderful organization.  I’ve been able to enjoy good health, and the way I feel today, I feel like I can still go on being part of this thing after forty some odd years of business, and also, to have the public appreciate and accept what I’ve done all these years.  That, that is a great reward… Well of course, happiness is a state of mind.  You can be happy or you can be unhappy.  It’s just according to the way you look at things.  You know.  So I think happiness is contentment but it doesn’t mean you have to have wealth.  But all individuals are different.  Some of us just wouldn’t be satisfied with just carrying out a routine job and being happy.  Yet I envied those people.  I had a brother who I really envied because he was a mailman.  But he’s the one that had all the fun.  He had himself a trailer, and he used to go out and go fishing, and he didn’t worry about payrolls and stories and picture grosses or anything.  And he was the happy one.  I always said, ‘He’s the smart Disney.’
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As the original Mary Poppins budget of five million dollars continued to grow, I never saw a sad face around the entire Studio.  And this made me nervous.  I knew the picture would have to gross 10 million dollars for us to break even.  But still there was no negative head-shaking.  No prophets of doom.  Even Roy was happy.  He didn’t even ask me to show the unfinished picture to a banker.  The horrible thought struck me – suppose the staff had finally conceded that I knew what I was doing.
