[In August 2003] My father is my principal mentor.  He’s 81 years old and still working.  He’s helped me set up a property division of Thorney over the past four years.

What has been interesting to see is how easy it is for prices to come off, particularly in the medium and small cap range, as liquidity dries up.  Usually what happens is it gets overdone and it can present buying opportunities.
<BR><a href="alex-waislitz-quotes.html">Alex Waislitz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On medium and small cap shares.] The price falls can be exacerbated if any of the small cap fund managers find they have redemptions in their funds and are required to raise cash in a less than orderly fashion [such as through selling shares to raise cash.]

A tribe of Indians in Canada went to their chief to ask how cold the upcoming winter would be so they could prepare by collecting the right amount of wood.  The chief told the tribe that it would be a cold winter and so the tribe went out and started collecting wood to keep them warm when winter arrived.  The next week the tribe decided to again ask the chief whether the winter would be cold and again he said he thought it would be cold.  So the tribe went out again and collected more wood.  About this time, the chief through he would call on the local meteorologist to find out if in fact his feeling about it being cold was correct.  The meteorologist told the chief it was indeed going to be a very cold winter.  Another week passed and winter was fast approaching.  The tribe asked the chief a third time if he thought it was going to be a cold winter.  For a third time he said it was going to be cold.  Off went the tribe and collected more wood.  In the meantime, the chief went back to the meteorologist to ask how could it would be.  The meteorologist said he thought it would be the coldest winter on record.  The chief asked him why he was so sure and he said, ‘You know it’s going to be cold when the Indians are collecting as much wood as they can.’

Our approach to investing is still fundamentally base on a value investment approach.  We look at the fundamentals of the business, focus on management and make an assessment of where the company go in its market.
<BR><a href="alex-waislitz-quotes.html">Alex Waislitz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
No matter how much work and preparation you put into a transaction there is always the unexpected or unpredictable that can potentially wipe you out, which therefore requires you to have a degree of diversity and spread of risk.
<BR><a href="alex-waislitz-quotes.html">Alex Waislitz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
No matter how smart or diligent you think you have been, you must avoid the classic risk of having all your eggs in one basket.
<BR><a href="alex-waislitz-quotes.html">Alex Waislitz<a/>

[In 2005] I think without a doubt anyone who wants to be serious about the investment game needs to make several trips to China to get a sense of what is going on there.
<BR><a href="alex-waislitz-quotes.html">Alex Waislitz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2005] I think the Australian market is still very sensitive to the US economy… While China is the biggest new influence, the US still is the key to world growth and equity markets.

<BR><a href="alex-waislitz-quotes.html">Alex Waislitz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2005] I remain convinced that the convergence of computer power, robotics, nanotechnologies and biotechnology, coupled with the impact of the human genome project and similar work, is going to change the world forever… I stress again, the area is not for the faint-hearted.

<BR><a href="alex-waislitz-quotes.html">Alex Waislitz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

My parents came out of the Holocast era.  They came here with nothing, couldn’t speak the language.  It was the classic immigrant story of hard work, sweat and sacrifice.
<BR><a href="alex-waislitz-quotes.html">Alex Waislitz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father being a real estate salesman and then getting into become a property developer.] I suppose he was an old school type of developer.  He didn’t believe in overborrowing, because he knew of the cycles in property and was prudent.
