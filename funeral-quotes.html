Death is inevitable. It is a democracy for all of the people, not an aristocracy for some of the people – kings die and beggars die; young men die and old men die; learned men die and ignorant men die. We need not fear it.
<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/>
<BR>

Western funerals: black hearses, and black horses, and fast-fading flowers. Why should black be the color of death? Why not the colors of a sunset?

<BR>
<BR>
Who knows when the end is reached? Death may be the beginning of life.
How do I know that love of life is not a delusion after all? How do I know that he who dreads to die is as a child who has lost the way and cannot find his way home?
How do I know that the dead repent of having previously clung to life? 
<BR><B>Chuang Tse</B>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><B>Ann-Marie MacDonald</B>
<BR>

Everything that has a beginning has an ending.
Make your peace with that and all will be well
<BR><B>Buddhist Saying</B>
<BR>
<BR>
There are only two ways to live your life. 
One is as though nothing is a miracle. 
The other is as though everything is a miracle.
<BR><B>Albert Einstein</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The heart hath its own memory, like the mind.  And in it are enshrined the precious keepsakes, into which is wrought the giver’s loving thought.

Your end, which is endless, is as a snowflake dissolving in the pure air.
<BR><B>Buddhist Saying</B>

Perhaps passing through the gates of death is like passing quietly through the gate in a pasture fence. On the other side, you keep walking, without the need to look back. No shock, no drama, just the lifting of a plank or two in a simple wooden gate in a clearing.  Neither pain, nor floods of light, nor great voices, but just the silent crossing of a meadow.
