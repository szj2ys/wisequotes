<BR><a href="satchel-paige-quotes.html">Satchel Paige<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="satchel-paige-quotes.html">Satchel Paige<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="satchel-paige-quotes.html">Satchel Paige<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
We raced for the bay and washed the dirt off.  Only we didn’t just go anywhere on the bay.  Just to certain parts.  The white man got all the rest.

We weren’t going to be eating much better if I made only a dime at a time so I got me a pole and some ropes.  That let me sling two, three, or four satchels together and carry them at one time.

<BR><a href="satchel-paige-quotes.html">Satchel Paige<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Since I threw those rocks so straight, I guess it was just natural that I started firing a baseball.
<BR><a href="satchel-paige-quotes.html">Satchel Paige<a/>

If I’d been left on the streets of Mobile to wander with those kids I’d been running around with, I’d of ended up as a big bum, a crook.  That’s what happened to a lot of those other kids.

<BR><a href="satchel-paige-quotes.html">Satchel Paige<a/>
<BR>
