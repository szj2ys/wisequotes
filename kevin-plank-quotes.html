My brothers used to give me wedgies and stick me in a closet.  That was their idea of babysitting.  The idea of being athletic – you really didn’t have any choices if you wanted to get off the coat hanger they’d stick you on.  And waiting for your underwear to rip was never fun.
<BR><a href="kevin-plank-quotes.html">Kevin Plank<a/>
<BR>

I wanted to play big-time college football.  After I finished at St. John's I wasn't getting recruited from programs and I was talking to Division III schools, so I decided to go to a prep school. I was young when I graduated. I had just turned 17. I probably could have used another year, so my parents sent me to Fork Union Military Academy.  In that one high school class I think we had 23 guys sign on for Division I-A.  Thirteen guys ended up being drafted to play in the NFL. We had one Heisman Trophy winner, Eddie George, in our class.

[On an Under Armour mock turtleneck being featured when Jeff George was on a front-page photo in USA Today] I remember thinking it’s going to be a big day.  The phone rang three times. One was from my mother telling me I still had to get this stuff out of my room at home. It taught me that there is no such thing as an overnight success. You have to get up and put your work boots on every single day.
<BR><a href="kevin-plank-quotes.html">Kevin Plank<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] Not too many companies out there with north of 93 percent of their business based in the United States can look at launching into a category that'll be a 100 percent allocated, where we have commitments that'll actually be sold for us.
<BR><a href="kevin-plank-quotes.html">Kevin Plank<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2011 in front of 1,000 Under Armour employees.] Boy, there’s a lot of talk out there.  Well, let me be the first to tell you guys today, we are not selling this company!
<BR><a href="kevin-plank-quotes.html">Kevin Plank<a/>

<BR><a href="kevin-plank-quotes.html">Kevin Plank<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his job offer after finishing college from Prudential Life Insurance.] I would have killed myself.
<BR><a href="kevin-plank-quotes.html">Kevin Plank<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I never knew exactly what [the company] was going to look like, but more important, I got up every single day and never believed it couldn't happen.
<BR><a href="kevin-plank-quotes.html">Kevin Plank<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2011] We have a young, beautiful workforce.  These were the cool kids in school.
