<BR>
I earned my name.  I was inspired by the classics, but they’re gone.  
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What I show you is real.  What did I do?  I created something.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I always liked Frank Sinatra… He was what he sang.  It was more than just a guy siniging.  It hit a note.  Today, that song feels like me.  I’ve been weathered, but I don’t feel like I’m over.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On a model of the Rhinelander] It was a summation of everything I believed in.  It was elegance.  It was old-world.  It was fulfillment.  It was arriving where I wanted to be…
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1993] This is the start of another era.  This is going forward into tomorrow.  It’s a second tier of my life.  We’re going into caring about our bodies, activity, health.  I can run five miles, work out, play tennis, do anything I want to do.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The boy played ball in the streets.  The grown-up stops and says, ‘Wait a minute.  I’m not playing ball anymore, but I want to work out.’  It’s more than vanity.  People are realizing what makes them feel good.  It’s what I feel and where I feel the world is going.  
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
That’s been the success.  I cater to myself.  People want what I want.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can’t coast when you have stores around the world and you have to do fashion shows twice a year.    
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You have a a look, but that look has to get better and better.  You’re gobbled up and spit out every two seconds.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On launching a company called Western Wear in 1978 in partnership with the Gap] It was the one thing we each did that wasn’t successful.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1989 on Calvin Klein considering leasing a building opposite Ralph Lauren] The rents were wild, wild.  I walked away.  I said, ‘If he wants to pay that, let him.’
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had a few babies that were growing…
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1993] This is a time to go more contemporary…
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Everyone says Ralph Lauren is traditional.  I was going the other way, but you couldn’t see it.  It got buried under the image.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On changing direction not being risky] It’s risky not to.  And it’s not like I’m dropping one for the other.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It starts in a very intimate place…
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his summer house in Montauk] It was very private.  I just fell in love with the place.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On mostly driving an old Ford Country Squire station wagon in 1993] I can go anywhere in that, and I don’t have to lock the doors.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Come to my Batman cave…
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1993 on his vintage cars] Cars today all look the same.  These cars are recreation, a hobby, and at the same time, they’re inspiring.  There are artists behind them, designers.  I love the details, the grooves.  And it’s art I can use.  I drive all of them… You’ll never see these again.

[On a 1938 Flash Gordonesque black Bugatti he owns] My personal rocket ship.  There are two in the world, and one was hit by a train in Paris and restored, so it’s not original.  Bugatti was a very elegant guy.  He walked around in jodhpurs and sold to kings.  If he didn’t like you, he wouldn’t sell to you.  Look at the details – the dashboard, the pedals, the tooling.  I find this very inspiring.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On clothes from his Rhinelander collections of classic camel polo coats and creamy flannel pants in 1993] That’s the key.  It’s more sophisticated than just sweats.  I’m going to take a sweatshirt and put it with a pair of gray flannels and a cashmere sweater, and all of a sudden it’s going to be a chic look.  These are things I never thought I’d do.  Dior couldn’t have done this.  Norell couldn’t have done this.  It’s a very new philosophy of design.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his Double RL visual concept] This was meant to look like the kind of things you collect all your life that you love and you can’t get any more of.  It’s to show the subtlety and artistry of what men are about.  
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People used to say, ‘You look like a schmuck, Ralph.  What are you wearing?’  They didn’t get it.  All of a sudden, they get it.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m not creating a new world.  What I’m doing is creating the know-how and the taste level and showing you how to wear it so it’s not in-and-out of fashion.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As fashion gets too fashiony, they go contrary.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Double RL] This is about America.  This is about college.  It’s about the thirties, the forties, the fifties, the sixties, the nineties.  It’s a timeless spirit.  The leather jacket, the worn-out flannel shirt, the beat-up hat, represent living, not fashion.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There was no sense I would ever be a fashion designer.  I was a kid just like you.  I played ball all the time.  I was inspired seeing movies.  I always wanted to be the star of the movie, but I never thought I’d be a movie star.  I wasn’t Walter Mitty.  I had a good life, I always had a girl, I had friends.  I had family.  Clothes were not my whole life.  I think I just, at a very early age, looked cool. 
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his business having a turnover of $400,000 in 1968, $3.4 million in 1971 and $7 million in 1974] We built the business too rapidly… [The accountant] Was over his head, and he didn’t tell me.  It was scary.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My problem was, I wanted to own… my own company.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On him demanding a new customer getting his input into how the good would be sold] I wanted to have my things the way I believed.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On him owning his first store in London in 1983 after it had been open for two years by Browns] It wasn’t working.  It wasn’t set up right.  I bought the store because [Browns] wanted to close it.  [It became a raging success]
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On setting up his own off-price outlets] We were having trouble with outlets putting our stuff on sale.  Closeouts.  Odds and ends.  We had to control that to protect the stores that were selling us.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve never had a sense of flying high.  Companies have to grow.  If you’re doing a lot of business, you have to buy more piece goods.  You have people who want raises, you want to keep them.  You can’t just sit still.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We didn’t want an English house or an American house.  We wanted something timeless, eclectic, not stuffy, but quality.  It was the hardest thing I ever had to do in my life.  You have to look for things you really love, for what your dream is.  I bought everything in this house.  No one bought it for me.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On pointing out the shining pipes under his bathroom sinks in his house] These details inspire me.  The brass.  The way it curves.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I care what it feels like and what it says to me.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Antique gilt could be interesting.  Take the tweediness out.  Make it more romantic and rich.  Gild the bed, then put the velvet, then the olive, then the Fair Isle.  Suede-colored sheets and I think we’ve got it.  The gilt solved the problem.  Perfect.  Perfect.  This has the spirit of everything we do, right in one shot.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1973] I’ve been doing [Robert] Redford’s clothes since I got him out of jeans.  But I’d never even met [Barbra] Streisand.  Her secretary called the other day and asked could I do some clothes for Barbra.  You know, I got really excited.
<BR><a href="ralph-lauren-quotes.html">Ralph Lauren<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I didn’t graduate.  At nineteen I was a salesman for Brooks Brothers.  Then I went into the Army, and when I got out I was an assistant buyer for Allied Stores.  After that Beau Brummel hired me.  They are a clip-on tie company in Cincinnati.  I sold them an idea – using different kinds of fabric for wider ties.  I had the ties made by a contractor, packed them myself and delivered them to the stores wearing a bomber jacket and jeans.  They went wild for the ties…
