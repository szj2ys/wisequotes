Your average punter see not further than finding a job and working for someone else.  Business is viewed as a risk – and people are frightened to take the risk in case they fail.  You will understand the buzz once you have done something on your own.  In a funny way, the money takes second place.

<BR>
[On naming his company AMSTRAD after Alan Michael Sugar Trading] It was more luck than judgement.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On becoming a manufacturer with a 500% profit margin rather than a 10% one.] I’d risen above being just a buyer and seller.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On why ‘The Apprentice’ has become such a phenomenal success.] There’s an air of excitement about watching people outside their comfort zone – and there’s the conflict.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the show the Dragons’ Den] I love it, I leap out of my chair, especially when someone brings on something electronic, I’m screaming, ‘Don’t invest!’
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On selling his company Amstrad in 2007 to Rupert Murdoch’s BskyB for 125 million pounds.] I cannot imagine a better home for the Amstrad business and its talented people.  Our companies share the entrepreneurial spirit of bringing innovation to the largest number of customers.

<BR>
<BR>
It’s very easy for people to blame the top man when things are no good but what you have to look deeper at is what these problems are.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A real successful man puts the love of his wife and children first, a real successful man’s greatest position in life is to have a great family… everything I have today is because of the love of that lady and the respect my three children have for the both of us.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m straight, I’m blunt, and I won’t always be popular.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have a passion and commitment to try and help small businesses and enterprise to see if we can get things moving again.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Straight talking, that’s me…
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I just can’t bear having to be false – talking to someone just to get something out of it, financially or socially.  If you want new friends and associates, they should be just that – genuine friends and associates.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Because I’ve got such a good memory, I sometimes wrongly assume that people I employ or deal with remember things in the same level of detail as I do.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve learnt to become a little more tolerant.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes wealth can bring about snobbery…
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have always tried to keep my feet on the ground and talk to everybody the same way, regardless of their status, because I remember where I came from.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The easiest way of frightening somebody is to tell them that they may be exposing themselves to possible financial claims.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The type of person I am – I need to know everything that’s going on in my company…
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have the greatest respect for women in business.  Some of the best people I’ve ever employed have been women.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On so many things now been made in Taiwan/South Korea and China.] What caused this shift?  Again, I say work ethic.  With my own eyes I saw Taiwan and South Korea rise to become the greatest force in electronics over a period spanning thirty years.  They were eager to learn, they worked hard and were relentless; they never gave up.  If they wanted to be in a certain sector, they did it, and they did it well.  Now we have the Chinese doing the same.

<BR>
Learn to speak Chinese.  I can tell you, they are going to take over the world economically, and a new generation of Westerners who speak Chinese will do well in this massive opportunity.  Be warned – you’d better learn to speak Chinese quicker than their kids learn to speak English, or you will miss a great opportunity.  
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve often told people that I don’t read too many books simply because I read for a living at the office.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Sorry ITV, but your adverts are wasted on me!
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Do you really want to see a world without the BBC?
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Be a nice person.  Learn to be respectful to your elders.  Respect the law and don’t be a lout.  Temptation is one of the worst things in life.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Have an opinion, by all means, but don’t discount the fact that people older than you have seen a lot more in life that you have yet to come across.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Psychologically, overeating and anorexia are two sides of the same coin.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am not foolish as to believe I’m going to succeed in maintaining my weight level for ever.  I’m old enough and wise enough to have learned, from my forty-odd years of yo-yoing up and down, that it could happen again.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s not the money, trust me…
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
An entrepreneur cannot be grown; a person is born with entrepreneurial spirit within them.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Entrepreneurial spirit does lie buried in the subconscious of many people, and it takes day-to-day opportunities and experience in business for it to actually flourish.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve always been an honest trader…
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You either have something or you don’t.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If I’d never started fires and had never bought plain sticks, there would never have been a deal – it was my experience that gave me the opportunity.
<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="alan-sugar-quotes.html">Alan Sugar<a/>
<BR>
