When you start planting acorns, the full-fledged oak may take years.  And I was beginning to learn what all gardeners must know – patience.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To see a seed flower, it has to be planted.

It seemed to me they were so close to the present picture they couldn’t see a future.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>

It always started with a dream.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>

<BR>
I wanted the largest hotel in the world.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I learned at twenty-one how a man feels when he has been given a job but complete confidence has been withheld.  It couldn’t work.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On fitting more beds and revenue streams into a hotel] The trick in packing a box is to pack a full box.  This had nothing to do with crushing or crowding, only the intelligent use of what is available.  
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Soap, water and elbow grease; those are the three ingredients for success in the hotel business.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you climb Mount Everest, no matter how carefully you plan, anything can happen.  Your ice axe slips, your oxygen gives out.  A concealed crevasse swallows you up.  Well, that’s about the way it was building my first Hilton Hotel.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On investing his own money first] I have never once in my life asked anyone to follow me financially into an adventure when I was not willing to take the lead.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Worrying has never solved anything yet.  Prayer, thought, action – yes.  Just worrying, no!
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Enthusiasm is the vital element toward the individual success of every man or woman.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I admit that I delight in the company of frank and honest men.  I have an instinctive horror for dishonesty.  I cannot conceive of rejoicing for an instant from having earned a single dollar from cupidity or trickery.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is impossible for a man to live without having some preconceived idea of where his life is going.  As far back as I can remember, I was marked with the sign of enthusiasm.  With enthusiasm to propel me, and prayer to shield me, I can say that I like what I’ve done with my life.  Inevitably, with such attributes, it is difficult not to lead a full, active, happy life.  Give a man the ambition to spur him on, the faith to guide him, and the good health to allow him to fulfill his potential, and he will, in one form or another, achieve success.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My second principle is the necessity to create team spirit amongst personnel.  I got the employees together and told them that their behavior would help make the clients happy so they’d come back.  I applied this formula my whole life long.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>

[On enthusiasm] It has been my experience that there is nothing worth doing that can be done without it.  Ability you must have, but ability sparked with enthusiasm.  Enthusiasm is an inexhaustible force, so mighty that you must never tame and temper it with wisdom.  Use it and you will find yourself constantly moving forward to new forms of expression.

<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To worry about your difficulties after the sun is set and you have done all you can for the day is useless – and an act of distrust.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We mean these hotels as a challenge – not to the peoples who have so cordially challenged us into their midst – but to the way of life preached by the Communist world.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I have a problem and have done all I can to figure it, I keep listening in a sort of inside silence ‘til something clicks and I feel the right answer.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his childhood home] Here a man drew some of that vastness into his soul.  He could dream big dreams, think big thoughts because there was nothing to hem him in.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I suddenly realized that a man could… develop a vast appetite in this country.  Fancy dishes were all very well in the civilized confines of New York or Hollywood.  What I wanted now was beefsteak, one that had been carved with no thought but that of plain hunger…
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On buying the biggest hotel in the world]  I began to do immediately, was to buy first-mortgage bonds, sometimes for as low as twenty cents on the dollar, once in a while as high as sixty.  This again was a technique I was to use in acquiring large hotels, because if I held enough bonds, when the time came to try for the purchase, my foot was already in the door.

<BR>
<BR>
Dig for gold.  It means utilization of every possible foot of space for the production of maximum income.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Did you ever think what can happen to a plain bar of iron worth about $5.00?  The same iron when made into horseshoes is worth $10.50.  If made into needles, it is worth $3,250.85, and if turned into balance springs for watches it’s value jumps to $250,000.  The same is true of another kind of material – YOU!

<BR>
<BR>

Dream Big.  3) Be honest 4) Live with enthusiasm 5) Don’t let your possessions possess you 6) Don’t worry about your problems 7) Don’t cling to the past.  8) Look up to people when you can – down to no one 9) Assume your full share of responsibility for the world in which you live.

[In a local hotel] I hope I’m not too late for lunch.  ‘I’m afraid you are, sir,’ he said.  ‘About ten years too late.’  Trade had fallen off so much it had been that long since they served luncheon.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My mother had one answer, one cure, for everything.  Prayer!
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When my father’s financial sun was eclipsed by the panic of 1907 and with it my hopes for a formal education at Dartmouth, that elegant eastern college where they would magically turn me into a fine gentleman, Mother’s advice was the same.  ‘He knows what’s best for you, son.  Go and pray.’
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The Great Depression of the ‘30s tossed my own life’s work from a tidy little mound of success into a bottomless pit of debts, humiliations, and mortgages.  
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We earned every penny we got.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Business praise from my father was hard won and much cherished by his children.  And the reverse cast us into the depths.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Before I was eighteen I had been a clerk, a roving trader, a minor speculator, and had my first experience in the hotel business at approximately the bellboy level.  I had owned my own produce business and as my own sole employee had hoed the corn, watered the vegetables, and then toured the town selling my harvest from door to door, or on order to my mother.  I got ten cents for twelve ears of corn, I recall, and thought I was doing very well.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There’s enthusiasm, and finding your talent, and a lot of other things that go to make up successful living.  But these two are the basic ones.  Without them you can’t even start.
<BR><a href="conrad-hilton-quotes.html">Conrad Hilton<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You had to dream!  I’ll admit this is the last suggestion most people would expect to be thrown into the pot by a businessman.  I’ll also admit no one ever called me a dreamer and that you can’t succeed without the other two parts [Enthusiasm and finding your talent], but it’s where you start.  At least, I realized, it’s where I started.
