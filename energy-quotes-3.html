<BR>
The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and to utilise combined energy. When he utilises combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.
<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal. 
<BR><B>Albert Camus</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
If you took one-tenth the energy you put into complaining and applied it to solving the problem, you'd be surprised by how well things can work out... Complaining does not work as a strategy. We all have finite time and energy. Any time we spend whining is unlikely to help us achieve our goals. And it won't make us happier. 
<BR><B>Randy Pausch</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Energy is an eternal delight, and he who desires, but acts not, breeds pestilence. 
<BR><B>William Blake</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Passion is the energy that love creates with no object other than itself.
<BR><a href="deepak-chopra-quotes.html">Deepak Chopra<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The sensitive plate, the gas which is ionised, the fluorescent screen, are in reality receivers, into another kind of energy, chemical energy, ionic energy… luminous energy.
<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The difference between one man and another is not mere ability . . . it is energy.
<BR><B>Thomas Arnold</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The more you lose yourself in something bigger than yourself, the more energy you will have. 
<BR><B>Norman Vincent Peale</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Youth is a question of energy.
<BR><B>Vanessa Paradis</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
People spend too much time finding other people to blame, too much energy finding excuses for not being what they are capable of being, and not enough energy putting themselves on the line, growing out of the past, and getting on with their lives.
<BR><B>J Michael Straczynski</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Goals help you channel your energy into action. 
<BR><B>Les Brown</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate success formula: I) Decide what you want (Be precise! Clarity is power) II) Take action (because desire is not enough) III) Notice what’s working or not (You don’t want to continue to expend energy on an approach that’s worthless IV) Change your approach until you achieve what you want (Flexibility gives you the power to create a new approach and a new result.)
<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Life should be built on the conservation of energy. 
<BR><B>Herbert M Shelton</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Education without social action is a one-sided value because it has no true power potential. Social action without education is a weak expression of pure energy. Deeds uninformed by educated thought can take false directions. When we go into action and confront our adversaries, we must be as armed with knowledge as they. Our policies should have the strength of deep analysis beneath them to be able to challenge the clever sophistries of our opponents.
<BR><B>Martin Luther King Jr</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
The chief condition on which, life, health and vigor depend on, is action. It is by action that an organism develops its faculties, increases its energy, and attains the fulfillment of its destiny. 
<BR><B>Colin Powell</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
A person of intellect without energy added to it, is a failure.
<BR><B>Sebastien-Roch Nicolas De Chamfort</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Pain in the present is experienced as hurt. Pain in the past is remembered as anger. Pain in the future is perceived as anxiety. Unexpressed anger, redirected against yourself and held within, is called guilt. The depletion of energy that occurs when anger is redirected inward creates depression.
<BR><a href="deepak-chopra-quotes.html">Deepak Chopra<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Love always brings difficulties, that is true, but the good side of it is that it gives energy. 
<BR><B>Vincent Van Gogh</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
The greatest weariness comes from work not done.
<BR><B>Eric Hoffer</B>
<BR>
<BR>
America’s number one energy crisis is Monday Morning.

<BR>
Love is a sacred reserve of energy; it is like the blood of spiritual evolution. 
<BR><B>Pierre Teilhard de Chardin</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
And what is a man without energy?  
<BR><B>Mark Twain</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as your car runs more smoothly and requires less energy to go faster and farther when the wheels are in perfect alignment, you perform better when your thoughts, feelings, emotions, goals, and values are in balance. 
<BR><B>Brian Tracy</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Even though the body appears to be material, it is not. In the deeper reality, your body is a field of energy, transformation and intelligence.
<BR><a href="deepak-chopra-quotes.html">Deepak Chopra<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Do you remember the things you were worrying about a year ago?  How did they work out?  Didn’t you waste a lot of fruitless energy on account of most of them?  Didn’t most of them turn out all right after all?
<BR><B>Dale Carnegie</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The capacity for hope is the most significant fact of life. It provides human beings with a sense of destination and the energy to get started. 
<BR><B>Norman Cousins</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Energy and persistence alter all things.
<BR><B>Benjamin Franklin</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Wealth flows from energy and ideas. 
<BR><B>William Feather</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Energy is an eternal delight, and he who desires, but acts not, breeds pestilence.
<BR><B>William Blake</B>
<BR>
<BR>
There's something about taking a plow and breaking new ground. It gives you energy. 
<BR><B>Ken Kesey</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Haters never win. I just think that's true about life, because negative energy always costs in the end. 
<BR><B>Tom Hiddleston</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Too many of us are hung up on what we don’t have, or won’t ever have.  We spend too much energy being down, when we could use that same energy-if not less of it-doing, or at least trying to do, some of the things we really want to do.
<BR><B>Terry Mcmilan</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.
<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The energy born of love is creative – it makes everything it touches new. To see how passionate you are, look around at what you have created.
<BR><a href="deepak-chopra-quotes.html">Deepak Chopra<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Money is life energy that we exchange and use as a result of the service we provide to the universe.
<BR><a href="deepak-chopra-quotes.html">Deepak Chopra<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When our identity comes from the self, then we keep our energy to ourselves. We feel energetic, we feel powerful, and we experience youthful vigor.
<BR><a href="deepak-chopra-quotes.html">Deepak Chopra<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As a leader, you must be filled with energy and eagerness, joy and love for what you do. If you lack enthusiasm for your job, you cannot perform to the best of your ability.  Industriousness is unattainable without Enthusiasm.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Nothing goes to waste, you put it all to use, the old wounds and long-ago slights become the stuff of competitive energy. 
<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If the total energy of the universe must always remain zero, and it costs energy to create a body, how can a whole universe be created from nothing?
<BR><a href="stephen-hawking-quotes.html">Stephen Hawking<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Nothing has since changed my point of view on that matter. Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
