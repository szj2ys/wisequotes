Dreams can drive you.  Dreams can make you skip over obstacles.  When you allow your dreams to pull you, they unleash a creative force that can overpower any obstacle in your path.  To unleash this power, though, your dreams must be well-defined.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Their dreams were stronger than the obstacles in their way.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You’ve got to be willing to put yourself through the paces of doing the uncomfortable until it becomes comfortable.  Because that’s how you realise your dreams.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>They have a dream.  And so should you.  Your success depends on it.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you empty a pitcher of coke into a glass, how much can it hold?  Only what the glass can hold.  <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The philosophy of the rich versus the poor is this: The rich invest their money and spend what is left; the poor spend their money and invest what is left.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>I used to say, "Things cost too much." Then my teacher straightened me out on that by saying, "The problem isn't that things cost too much. The problem is that you can't afford it." That's when I finally understood that the problem wasn't "it" - the problem was "me!"<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We all know a variety of ways to make a living. What's even more fascinating is figuring out ways to make a fortune.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The Bible says that it is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. It doesn't say that it is impossible!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>To become financially independent you must turn part of your income into capital; turn capital into enterprise; turn enterprise into profit; turn profit into investment; and turn investment into financial independence.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Part of your heritage in this society is the opportunity to become financially independent.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you depend on your company to take care of your retirement, your future income will be divided by five. Take care of it yourself, and you can multiply your future income by five.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>I remember saying to my mentor, "If I had more money, I would have a better plan." He quickly responded, "I would suggest that if you had a better plan, you would have more money." You see, it's not the amount that counts; it's the plan that counts.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you were to show me your current financial plan, would I get so excited by it that I would go across the country and lecture on it? If the answer is no, then here's my question: Why not? Why wouldn't you have a superior financial plan that is taking you to the places you want to go?<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Shortly after I met my mentor he asked me," Mr. Rohn, how much money have you saved and invested over the last six years?" And I said, "None." He then asked, 'Who sold you on that plan?"<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It is better to be a lender than a spender.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We can have more than we've got because we can become more than we are.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. You cannot believe what it does to the human spirit to maximize your human potential and stretch yourself to the limit.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Pity the man who inherits a million dollars and who isn't a millionaire. Here's what would be pitiful: If your income grew and you didn't.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR><BR>To attract attractive people, you must be attractive. To attract powerful people, you must be powerful. To attract committed people, you must be committed. Instead of going to work on them, you go to work on yourself. If you become, you can attract.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The most important question to ask on the job is not "What am I getting?" The most important question to ask on the job is "What am I becoming?"<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It is hard to keep that which has not been obtained through personal development.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>After you become a millionaire, you can give all of your money away because what's important is not the million dollars; what’s important is the person you have become in the process of becoming a millionaire.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The key factor that will determine your financial future is not the economy; the key factor is your philosophy.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't borrow someone else's plan. Develop your own philosophy and it will lead you to unique places.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you learn to set a good sail, the wind that blows will always take you to the dreams you want, the income you want, and the treasures of mind, purse, and soul you want.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Your philosophy determines whether you will go for the disciplines or continue the errors.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Philosophy is the sum total of all that you know and what you decide is valuable.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Economic disaster begins with a philosophy of doing less and wanting more.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>If you want to amend your errors, you must begin by amending your philosophy.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The only thing worse than not reading a book in the last ninety days is not reading a book in the last ninety days and think that it doesn't matter.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Your personal philosophy is the greatest determining factor in how your life works out.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Initial response illustrates a great deal about someone's personal philosophy.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Only human beings can reorder their lives any day they choose by refining their philosophy.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't become a victim of yourself. Forget about the thief waiting in the alley; what about the thief in your mind?<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It is not what happens that determines the major part of your future. What happens, happens to us all. It is what you do about what happens that counts.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You say, "The country is messed up." That's like cursing the soil and the seed and the sunshine and the rain, which is all you've got. Don't curse all you've got. When you get your own planet, you can rearrange this whole deal. This one you've got to take like it comes.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Walk away from the 97% crowd. Don't use their excuses. Take charge of your own life.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Take advice, but not orders. Only give yourself orders.
