[In November 2009 on her first property.] I bought a tiny two-bedroom flat in Prahran, in Melbourne.  I purchased it in 1988 for $85,000 in a private sale. I had attended some auctions before and found them very nerve-racking.  Given it was my first home, I budgeted carefully. The only problem was that interest rates were at 16 per cent in that time.  I sold it in 1992 for $105,000.

<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009 on her first property.] When I bought the flat, an old person who was a chronic smoker had owned it. The place stank and the walls were dripping with a yellow layer.  I painted everything white. Pulled up the carpet, laid new carpet, put cork tiles in the kitchen, and my father helped me change the kitchen cupboard doors. 
I went to IKEA and bought all simple black furniture and added bright-coloured cushions and pictures. It was fun and completely different.
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009.] I learnt how stingy people in flats can be.  The old man in the flat underneath mine used to put his power cord out into the stairwell so that the body corporate paid for his power.

<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012.] Great businesses solve problems. They make life easier - they do things that had not been done before. They make a difference to other human beings. In fact, you could argue that great businesses make the world a better place.
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012.] Businesses are 1 per cent idea and 99 per cent execution.
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012.] Are you building a better mousetrap or are you changing the game of rodent management?
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012.] I started RedBalloon in the front room of my home in 2001, using little more than a few thousand  dollars and a second-hand computer, with my canine companion Dexter as my sounding-board.  Eleven years later we’re on track to becoming a $100 million business, and have delivered more than 1.5 million memorable experiences to Australians and New Zealanders.
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In April 2013.] Everyone is equal online.
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2013.] Curiosity and positivity are hard things to teach - you either have them or you don't.  But characteristics like focus and persistence can be learnt - and need to be. Without them you're unlikely to make it as an entrepreneur or business owner.
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2013.] We often have trouble imagining failure in the first place. But that doesn't mean failing is a bad thing. Failure is very much a reality of being an entrepreneur - we take risks and sometimes those risks don't pay off.
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In August 2013 on the beginning.] It was almost three months before RedBalloon made its first sale…

<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] Great work places are highly profitable.
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] We didn't have any money growing up.  They were really lean years so I've always understood the value of money.
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013 on buying her first apartment at age 22 for $80,000 and taking on a boarder, never going out and living on boiled eggs.] Interest rates went from about 8% all the way to 16%.  It became forced savings for me and I had a fabulous figure because I couldn't over-eat.

<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013 on her husband Peter being retrenched during the recession in 1991.] I was juggling money, trying to pay the mortgage, and we sold everything just to keep up the payments. He couldn't get a job for two years and in the end he started his own advisory business. It was really challenging.
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013 on her husband Peter.] We had 20 great years of marriage, two beautiful children and we created an amazing business together.

<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] In my 20s my definition was managing to get through the month with enough money in the bank. In my 30s it was able to buy a pair of shoes without looking at the price tag; by my 40s it was how I contribute to others and the time I have available for philanthropic work.

<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] It wasn’t always easy… You just get on with it.
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] What's the problem in being successful?
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2013.] I completely underestimated the energy and effort required to get customers
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My ego simply wouldn’t let me fail.
