How were people to think I was a flier if I was wearing a flying coat that was brand-new. Wrinkles! That was it. There just had to be some wrinkles. So—I slept in it for three nights to give my coat a properly veteran appearance. When I decided not to go to bed in it any longer, I did give it a last going over—rubbing the sheen off here and there.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>This modern world of science and invention is of particular interest to women, for the lives of women have been more affected by its new horizons than those of any other group. Profound and stirring as have been accomplishments in the remoter fields of pure research, it is in the home that the applications of scientific achievement have perhaps been most far-reaching, and it is through changing conditions there that women have become the greatest beneficiaries in the modern scheme.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Not only has applied science decreased the toil in the home, but it has provided undreamed of economic opportunities for women.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Probably no scientific development is more startling than the effect of this new and growing economic independence upon women themselves.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> The impetus of the sociological evolution of the last half century should be largely credited to those who have toiled in laboratories, and those who have translated into practical use the fruits of such labors.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Perhaps I'm prejudiced, but to me it seems that no other phase of modern progress contrives to maintain such a brimming measure of romance and beauty, coupled with utility as does aviation.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Aviation, this young modern giant, exemplified the possible relationship of women and the creations of science. Although women as yet have not taken full advantage of its use and benefits, air travel is available to them as to men.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> As so often happens in introducing the new or changing the old, public acceptance depends peculiarly upon women's friendly attitude.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> May I hope this movement will spread throughout all branches of applied science and industry and that women may come to share with men the joy of doing. Those can appreciate rewards most who have helped create.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> One hears a lament that a mechanized world would not be a pleasant one in which to live. Quite the contrary should be true. And it can be true if the fine minds who have accomplished so much in the realms of applied science will unite with the same enthusiasm to control their creations against social misuse. <BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> This industry embraces many of those scientific accomplishments which yesterday seemed fantastic impossibilities.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>The soul that knows is no, knows no release from little things.  Knows not the livid loneliness of fear.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> After midnight the moon set and I was alone with the stars.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Anticipation, I suppose, sometimes exceeds realization.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Flying may not be all plain sailing, but the fun of it is worth the price.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> The field was wet, the lane was wet and the spirits of my mechanic and helper were damp.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Flying is perhaps the most dramatic of recent scientific attainment. In the brief span of thirty-odd years, the world has seen an inventor's dream, first materialized by the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk, become an everyday actuality.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Preparation, I have often said, is rightly two-thirds of any venture.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Adventure is worthwhile in itself.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> My ambition is to have this wonderful gift produce practical results for the future of commercial flying and for the women who may want to fly tomorrow's planes.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> The woman who can create her own job is the woman who will win fame and fortune. <BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>Candle dipping, weaving and crude methods of manufacturing necessities are things of the past for an increasing majority.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> [Women] must pay for everything.... They do get more glory than men for comparable feats. But, also, women get more notoriety when they crash.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> The more one does and sees and feels, the more one is able to do, and the more genuine may be one's appreciation of fundamental things like home, and love, and understanding companionship.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Now and then women should do for themselves what men have already done - occasionally what men have not done--thereby establishing themselves as persons, and perhaps encouraging other women toward greater independence of thought and action. Some such consideration was a contributing reason for my wanting to do what I so much wanted to do.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Never do things others can do and will do, if there are things others cannot do or will not do.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> No kind action ever stops with itself. One kind action leads to another. Good example is followed. A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. The greatest work that kindness does to others is that it makes them kind themselves.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do. You can act to change and control your life; and the procedure, the process is its own reward.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> [On what she thought about aviation movies] I think it’s too bad when aviation movies depend for their excitement on plane wrecks and lost flyers and all that sort of thing.  Perhaps that’s good drama but it certainly isn’t modern aviation… There was a picture based on Air Mail, not long ago, in which planes crashed right and left.  But that’s no more representative of the air mail service than a train wreck every half hour or so would be truly representative of rail transportation.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> How can life grant us boon of living, compensate for dull grey ugliness and pregnant hate, unless we dare….<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> If one gives out plans beforehand, one is likely to be charged with publicity seeking by those who do not know how difficult it is to escape the competent gentlemen of the press.  On the other hand, if one slips away, as I have generally tried to do, the slipper-away invites catcalls from those who earn their living writing and taking photographs.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="amelia-earhart-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="amelia-earhart-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="amelia-earhart-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="amelia-earhart-quotes-5.html">5<a/></p><p><BR>
