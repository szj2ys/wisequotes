[On telling Joseph Snavely he could keep books costing $74.50 around the year 1904 from Elbert Hubbard] You keep the books and I’ll keep the bill.

[On building a golf course in Hershey] The people of this community enjoy every facility, such as baseball, football, swimming and boating.  Now thinking they might want to play golf, I built a golf course.  Possibly in doing this I may have had an ulterior motive, for you see I also like to play a round of golf once in a while.

When I sold my caramel business in 1901, I retired from business and started out to see the world, but idleness didn’t sit well with me, so I got into the harness again.  I planned to build my factory in Lancaster but I was forced to look elsewhere.  I looked around a great deal before deciding on Derry Township where I was born.  Now I’m glad I did.  In the short time that we have been in the chocolate business we have done very nicely.  Far better than we anticipated.  In fact, gentlemen, I little dreamed in 1901 that there would ever be such a town as Hershey.

[On giving his fortune in 1909 to his trust to found a school for orphan boys] I don’t want you to make a hullabaloo about the school in your [news] paper.  If you do people might think that I founded the school to capitalize on the misfortune of others, and that I want them to buy my chocolate to support it.  Kitty [His wife who passed away] is of the same opinion.

[On using the Homestead Farm] We are going to use that farm as the nucleus of the school.  We intend to start in a small way – as a matter of fact, with four boys.  Some day we hope to be able to take care of one hundred boys.  That’s a lot of boys.  [On then being asked about girls or was it just for orphan boys] Just for boys.  There are relatives or outsiders who are glad to adopt girls, for they’re useful in the home.  Boys, however are somewhat of a nuisance around the house and no one wants to be bothered with them.  So, after talking the matter over with Kitty, we decided to make it a boys’ school.

<BR>
Why a farmer should want to move to the city is more than I can understand, for a farmer has a higher standard of living than a man who lives in the city.  The farmer, for instance, can build a house for the price of two or three years’ rent in the city.  The farmer doesn’t have to keep up his appearance, as does the man in the city.  The useless extravagance that makes the bill for clothing the heaviest drain on the city man’s pocketbook is lacking in the farmer’s case.  Men and women in the country are taken for what they are worth, and less for what they seem to be.

<BR>
The very foundation of our national life depends on the intelligent work of the farmer.  The future welfare of our people depends on the creation of a finer type of civic life, and I believe that we must look to the farmer to lead the way.

[On the question ‘To what do you attribute your phenomenal success?’] I started with ambition and intention of making the best chocolate that money or skill could make, regardless of the cost of manufacture.  I made it just as good as I knew how, and I have kept the quality just as good as it was in the beginning.  I’m paying today 400 percent more for one ingredient than I did in the beginning, but I’m using exactly the same percentage.  I believed that, if I put a chocolate on the market that was better than any one else was making, or was likely to make, and keep it absolutely uniform in quality, the time would come when the public would appreciate it and buy it.  And they have.

The town is growing and one man can’t supervise everything… you’ve got to work in harmony.

[On advertising in his newspaper] Only the other day an advertising man told me that if I would give him a percentage of our advertising appropriation, he would double our output.  He was astounded when I told him we didn’t have any advertising appropriation, and that we had built up our business without it.

[On his idea for a magazine potentially called ‘The Hershey Idea’] People are apt to buy it just to see what it’s all about.

As country bankers we haven’t done so badly.  The Pennsylvania-Dutch have always believed in saving for that proverbial rainy day and they know the value of a dollar.

<BR>
When our employees learn that drinking means the loss of their jobs, it will give them something to think about.
<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Every employee is a cog in the large Hershey business machine.  Now, a broken cog is useless, sometimes dangerous, and a drinking employee is the worst kind of ‘broken cog,’ one that even the largest and most altruistic corporations have discovered cannot be endured without loss to their business in reputation, property, or efficiency.
<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The quality of an employee’s work is directly affected to a degree that can be measured exactly in percentages of efficiency by his mental and physical condition when working.
<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
An employee who has been dissipating the night before going to his daily toil will be less accurate, less careful, and less rapid – in a word, less efficient in every way, and such employees in reality earn less than the wage paid – it may be ten, twenty-five, or even fifty percent.

<BR>
<BR>
[On Bernard M Baruch] Baruch’s experience has taught him that most of the failures in life have come from those who acted without knowing the facts.  In my own life this lesson was drummed in early, and I failed three times because I had not taken the time to get all the facts.  After that I learned my lesson well.  I also learned that you can surmount failure.  You can be battered down three times, as I was, and still come out on top.

[In 1942 at the age of 85 on being asked ‘In your opinion, Mr Hershey, what age in life is a man at his best?’] That’s a difficult question to answer.  Some men are washed up when they are forty, while others just get started at that age.  The other day I was shown an old newspaper clipping about myself which explained why I had founded the school for orphan boys.  The headline read, ‘Hershey Feels the End Is Near.’  Twenty-five years have passed since then, and in those years I have been able to accomplish many of the things I wanted to do.  That doesn’t look as though I sat down and waited for the end, does it?

<BR>
<BR>
[On being asked at the age of 85 ‘Then you consider there are no age limitations?’] Of course there are exceptions, but an interest in something new triumphs over the calendar.  Since I turned seventy years of age I have started dozens of new enterprises.  Now at eight-five I am engaged in the greatest enterprise of all, working for Uncle Sam.  [On helping the war effort in World War II]

I was called a dreamer, when I suggested building this town.  Now the dream is beginning to materialize, but it takes more than brick and mortar to build a town.  The social life is an important phase of a community, a man accomplishes little when he thinks and acts alone.

Some people think that I’ve had an easy time of it.  They say that I have the Hershey luck, whatever that is, and as a result money flowed into my lap.  But luck had nothing to do with my success.  As I see it, my success is the result of not being satisfied with mediocrity, and in making the most of my opportunities.

BONUS:  
<BR>[On Mr Hershey] ‘The secret of the accomplishments of the past few years can be explained only by the fact that there has been a purpose, a plan, and in addition to that purpose and plan, the purposer has ‘stuck’ until it has become a reality.’ 
<BR><B>Mr John E Snyder</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Mr Hershey] ‘It is a common mistake to assume that success is due to some genius, some magic, some inexplicable something.  It is clearly emphasized by Mr Hershey that success is due to holding on, and failure to letting go.’
