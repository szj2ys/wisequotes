I only knew that I was tired of being pushed around.  <BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> People always say that I didn’t give up my seat because I was tired, but that isn’t true…  No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> I said, ‘No.’  He said, ‘Well, I’m going to have you arrested.’  Then I said, ‘You may do that.’  These were the only words we said to each other.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> In fact if I had let myself think too deeply about what might happen to me, I might have gotten off the bus.

You could be risking your life.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> I am 83 years old, and I have come to realize that there is always more in life to learn.
