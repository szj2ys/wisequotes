<BR>
[To John Theodore] It was never the intention of your father and myself, when we formed our partnership, that a sudden division of interests should take place… I don’t think it is to your advantage.  But – if there is to be a break – let it be a complete one.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On losing 10 pounds playing a billiard game – ‘Never mind Frank.  It’s only money’] I know it’s only money, but this money happens to be my money.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We will never mention your name in the paper again.  We don’t want your advertising.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To Prime Minister Robert Menzies] Your letter plus the resounding good news about the Television licences greatly cheered us up… You have made this a happy little office.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Local live shows are as dull as ditchwater.  I don’t believe people look at television for local matter.  They like to be entertained.  They like to see the big events on television…
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Television is something more than a newspaper.  People don’t pay 200 or 300 pounds for a television set to get the results of the lamb sales at Flemington.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[When lodging applications for a television licence in Wollongong] The big money is tied up where the people are, two and a half million in Sydney, two million in Melbourne, and Adelaide and Brisbane.  If you take all the rest of the country stations, they don’t amount to a row of beans.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If we lose we’ll be back like [General Douglas] MacArthur – we’ll be back.  
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Australians being like an invading force in an America’s cup challenge] The natives are friendly at the moment – but later they may attack from the sea.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Whether we lost or not, the sun will come up tomorrow just the same.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We are in the big league now.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The French are temperamental.  I know, I married a Frenchwoman.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve been travelling for 28 hours, and I’m still licking my wounds.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To an Australian Prime Minister] That was a bloody awful speech.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To Ita Buttrose] I haven’t sold you.  Goodbye.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To Ita Buttrose] Well done.  You’re not only good-looking but talented.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I suppose every housewife is a tripteaser, and… [‘You mean inside, at heart?’] Well, I think, actually.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[‘How great an influence do you think the Women’s Weekly has in Australia on what women will wear or cook or be interested in?’] Well I don’t know, I’m not a woman.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think a woman’s place is in the home… I don’t know what you mean by women’s liberation.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What does a man do when he can’t get on with his family?

<BR>
[On the America’s Cup in 1970 in the ‘Gretel’] The boat is named after my dear departed wife.  I don’t want any advertisements sullying her name.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On a Telegraph photographer in 1960s taking an action shot of a polo game and being broadsided by the pony] For Christ’s sake, clear this photographer off the field, he’s holding up the game.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being two-three weeks away from being broke in the beginning when setting up a new newspaper and then the existing player coming in and saying ‘Well, there’s 80,000 quid in it if you don’t start the paper’] Done.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I know no more than you do.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think a woman’s place is in the home.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think predominantly women are going to be concerned with the home because a) they have the kids, b) they’ve got to rear the kids, they’ve got to look after them, change their nappies, feed them and do everything else, so I think they’re a bit uphill to try to avoid their obligation.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
No law compels you to read the Daily Telegraph if its views conflict with your own.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To a NSW premier in the 1965 elections] Look you need a supplementary campaign to get yourself into office.  You need a couple of guys who can move quick, think, and get their hands on some money quick.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1970 ‘How much does the Telegraph express your own political views?  I mean do you ever write editorials yourself?’] Occasionally.  [‘Only occasionally?’] Well when I say occasionally, I dictate quite a few to McNicoll… or I tell them I’d like an editorial along these lines, but I don’t have to do that very often.  After all, the policies are pretty well ironed out.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To Nigel Dick] Have you got that interview with Mrs Ryan in the second edition? [‘Yes.’] Well, take it out.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[At a Christmas party after a good year] If we have another good one, and I don’t sack the lot of you, I’ll see you again next year.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 1966 to the union] It is our affair if we choose to continue to use tables that are old tables or chairs that are old chairs.  That is our affair.  As for typewriters… surely it is the employer’s privilege to decide what typewriters he provides for reporters?
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On AJA’s complaint] Not enough chairs, what bloody nonsense.  McNicoll, go out there and count the chairs.  [There was enough chairs, and union retreated.  Then the new chairs were taken upstairs again to the clerks’ office from whence they had all been borrowed.]
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being asked in court in 1956 by Dr Herbert Evatt a former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia – ‘You went into the newspaper industry as a very young man and have been a newspaper executive almost from the beginning – trained for the position – and you are essentially a person with special experience and skill in the conduct of newspapers?  Is that correct?] Well, I am on oath.  I cannot deny it.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[After telling his Women’s Weekly Editor Esmee Fenston that it was raining hard and with the light being so bad they couldn’t get any photos with their group of four photographers for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics opening ceremony, then calling his personal secretary] Take a double brandy up to Mrs Fenston.  I believe she’s just fainted.  [It was actually shining brightly in Melbourne]
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
No Queen, no Packer.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At nine o’clock occasionally discovering a journalist still working on a story] What time did you start? [‘Twelve o’clock, this morning.’] You’re fired.  If it takes you nine hours to write a story and you still haven’t finished then you’re no good as a journalist.
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On an employee Donald Horne who had taken a car for organising the successful Sunday Telegraph Beach Girl Quest of 1947] I don’t care what you were trying to say!  Why would you want a car?  What’s wrong with the bus?  [‘There wasn’t a spare seat on the bus…’] You didn’t need a seat!  You could have stood up… [‘Well, I thought there were laws against that,,,’] Don’t try to be smart with me, Mr Horne!  You’re sacked! [Try’s to get him to pay for the hire of the car.  Horne refuses, the next day he is given his job back.]
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To a government mailman who didn’t work for him when he had stopped at his floor] What’s your job?  [‘Post boy, sir’] How much do you earn?  [‘Thirty bob’] Right, here’s two pounds, now get out, you’re sacked!
<BR><a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On sacking the wrong person] What is your name?  [‘Name…’] What do you do? [‘I’m a reader’] You were a reader, you mean.  Collect your money tomorrow, you’re finished.
