If you’re lacking the energy for your work it’s probably because it doesn’t excite you any more.  You need to rekindle your enthusiasm by getting your business more aligned with your passion.  The best cure for fatigue is to have lots of projects that you’re passionate and excited about.

I’m at a stage of my life where I don’t need to prove anything, I’m just doing what I want to do, and it’s a great place to be.  I’m working at a feverish pace, I’m having such a good time.  But my goals are no longer just geared to success.  No it’s about my life, about living, about time away from work, about my wife who I love so much.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>

Humility is really important for us.  We know that one of the dark sides of success is arrogance.  So we’re really committed to keeping our feet on the ground.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Change happens every single day, but the values of the organization (or person/family) should be constant.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>

[On his school report cards] I never kept my reports, I was so embarrassed about them, they were so terrible.  I stayed on in year twelve because I wanted to play football and I was playing first grade when I was fifteen years of age, so that was more important to me.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had no academic career lined up and I had no sporting career left, so I really turned the things that had allowed me to achieve certain success in sport towards the world of business.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>

I found out that I enjoyed selling.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I read about a book a week.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I read the BRW Rich 200 list and saw that so many people had built their wealth on property and I thought, ‘Well, if I can understand property…’
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I went for thirty-three jobs and got the job at my thirty-third interview.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>

Anyone that’s young and getting into real estate, I encourage them to start in leasing and property management.  It’s a great sounding board.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was twenty year of age and I decided to get into sales… it took me six months to sell anything.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On setting up McGrath Real Estate] I was ready to start and I lost my partner, and therefore I lost someone that was going to bring a lot of other expertise in operations and finance and bring in some capital.  But, you know, in hindsight, I’m really glad in a lot of ways that it went that way, because I did have the ability to create exactly what I wanted to create without any other restrictions…

I think Australia is pretty close to having some of the best real estate operators on the planet.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I research who are the best.  I ask questions, look at websites, research, look at industry statistics and then I make contact, if possible get a referral from someone I know that knows them, and then visit them.  I often spend a day or two talking to their managers, hanging out at their offices, looking at their training.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have an abundance mentality.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A lot of principals say, ‘Don’t promote your salesperson, don’t train them up too much because they’ll just leave and steal your clients’  Well, it’s the same thing as, ‘Don’t tell anyone else what you’re doing because they’ll go and copy it’.  My view is, if I want to learn from others, I’ve got to share my information too.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m a sales and marketing person by nature.  I love selling.  I love energy.  I love new ideas.  I love innovation.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I said to myself, ‘I will get myself out of debt and I want to have a business that’s going forward, that’s predominately debt free’, because I hated the feeling.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Know that the agent works for the vendor.  Don’t be naïve.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>

[On McGrath Real Estate] Why are we growing fast?  Because we don’t bullsh*t people.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Every five to seven years property typically doubles.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What I recommend to people is always buy property you can drive past.  It’s too easy to get caught out.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The only horror stories I’ve ever heard regarding people in real estate are from those that have bought interstate off the plan, from seminar-driven companies.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think anything that appears too good to be true probably is.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>

<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m not an extravagant person at all.  My greatest extravagance is my housekeeper.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t have boats.  I don’t have planes.  I don’t have luxury houses and stuff.  Really, you can get to a point where the stuff rules you.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I live well within my means, and a very simple life.
<BR><a href="john-mcgrath-quotes.html">John McGrath<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most markets are growing faster than you’ll ever be able to save.  So the question is not ‘Should I get in?, but ‘How can I get in?’
