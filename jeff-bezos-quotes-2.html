[In July 2010] When people come to me and they say, Jeff, you’ve got to have full motion video color on the Kindle.  I say, why?  Do you think Hemingway is going to pop more in color?

Right after World War II, Morita-son [Akio Morita], the guy who founded Sony, made the mission for Sony that they were going to make Japan known for quality.  And you have to remember, this was a time when Japan was known for cheap, copycat products.  And Morita-son didn’t say we’re going to make Sony known for quality.  He said we’re going to make Japan known for quality.  He chose a mission for Sony that was bigger than Sony. And when we talk about earth’s most customer-centric company, we have a similar idea in mind.  We want other companies to look at Amazon and see us as a standard bearer for obsessive focus on the customer as opposed to obsessive focus on the competitor.

Most businesses have either no impact on our financials for the first five to seven years or a negative impact on our financials for the first five to seven years.
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2010] The company is very healthy financially.  We’re doing very well.  And it’s an outcome of customer obsession.
