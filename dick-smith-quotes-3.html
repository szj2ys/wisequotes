<BR>
<BR>
A lot of people start businesses and the minute they do well they want to live up the image and buy, buy … In the end they drain all the cash and go broke.  Then they blame everyone else.

[On the helicopter he will use for flying around the world] It’s a brand new $400,000 Bell Jetranger with a Collins auto-pilot and a VLF-Omega navigation system.  It’s incredible.  It’s the only one of its type in the world.

<BR><a href="dick-smith-quotes.html">Dick Smith<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="dick-smith-quotes.html">Dick Smith<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I was 13 years of age, very impressionable age, dad opened a printing business. Dad worked in a bookshop and started his own business.

<BR><a href="dick-smith-quotes.html">Dick Smith<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Pip and I were very goal-orientated. We thought if we worked hard we would do well.  We thought doing well was having three or four people working for us.

[On naming Dick Smith Electronics] Originally I was going to call the business Alltronics And a relative of mine in advertising said, ‘That's crazy. Use your own name.’ I was so self-conscious, I thought it wouldn't work. People with a Mercedes will never come in to a place called ‘Dick Smith’. Luckily he said, ‘Yes they will, use your own name.’ It was the best thing I could have done.
<BR><a href="dick-smith-quotes.html">Dick Smith<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I've been wise enough never to get into a business unless I know there's a good chance of success and in fact I've never been on an adventure unless there's a good chance of success. So far I've succeeded because I'm realistic.
<BR><a href="dick-smith-quotes.html">Dick Smith<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There's a formula for being successful in business. That's a simple formula. Copy the success of others, ask advice and work damn hard, keep the overheads low, of course. It's so easy, I've never had problems in making money.
<BR><a href="dick-smith-quotes.html">Dick Smith<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
