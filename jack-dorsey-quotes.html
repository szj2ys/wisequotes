<BR>
My goal is to simplify complexity.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Twitter is about simplicity.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Life really happens at intersections.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
An idea that can change the course of the company can come from anywhere.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You don’t have to start from scratch to do something interesting.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You don’t have to start from scratch to have a massive impact on the world.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Twitter was not started because we started a company.  Twitter was started because we had a good idea, and it started out of a failed company.  That can happen out of any company today.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Expect the unexpected.  And whenever possible, be the unexpected.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When you simplify… When you get down to the essence, you fix so many things.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I just want to build stuff that really simplifies our base human interaction.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s really complex to make something simple…
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Any great founders need to get out of the way of the company.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Civilization is meant to be easy…
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2011] We have built the simplest way to accept credit cards.  It’s a little 
tiny device that we give away for free, and you just download some softwares 
from the app store and plug it in to your mobile phone or iPad and suddenly 
you can take credit cards.  So if you’re a tax accountant or a lawyer or 
doctor or even a hair stylist, you can now accept credit cards.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2011] We take a cut of every transaction.  So we charge 2.75 percent and 15 cents on the transaction.  Which we then pay the credit card  companies out of.  So the user only has to pay that 2.75 percent.  They don’t pay any credit card fees.  They don’t have to have a setup charged.  They don’t have to pay for the hardware or even the software.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s really complex to make something simple and especially when you started addressing the financial world.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Let’s make it easy and take more and more of the friction out as we can.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve always been fascinated by cities and how they work.  And I taught myself how to program so I can understand how the city works.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the first twitter tweet] The first tweet that was actually written by a human was by me and it was inviting co-workers.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
I was leading a lot of idea and the vision for where the product was going.  Ev [Evan Williams] was funding and supporting what we were doing.  He put the shelter over our heads.  And Biz [Stone] was just an amazingly creative guy.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We so much time putting these organizations and public figures on this massive, massive pedestal, but we have to remember they go through all the small details of live that we do.  And you can make them human again and 
you can interact with them.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Twitter and Japan] We’ve had massive success in Japan… In Japan, it’s not 140 characters, it’s 140 words.  So you could write a little mini-novel.  This is a whole story in the universe.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s so easy to tweet from wherever you are.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
For any Silicon Valley company, the most important thing is the company.  And any great founders need to get out of the way of the company.  We presented a spark with an idea.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Twitter] This company is bigger than any individual.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My strength is programming.  I also think my biggest strength is simplification.  That’s what I love doing.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I love making something complex.  I love taking everything away, taking all the debris, the conceptual debris from a technology away so that you can just focus on 
what’s most important.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2011] There are so many features Twitter could build.  There’s so many features that Square can build.  But there is only one or two going to bring us to the next level.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I love building technology, I love programming.  I love building teams.  And I also love building beautiful things.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I love art, I love design, and I love seeing that intersection of technology and the teams that work on it.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2011] I think the important thing for Twitter is that it works on any technology.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2011] I think Twitter is so unique that we must stay independent.  
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
How do we get people to discover what’s most important?
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
How do we surface what’s happening right now that someone should pay attention to?
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2011] We’re focused on building a product and a business.  Going public is an instrument and tool to help sustain the company.  In the future, there may be an IPO, but I don’t know what the timing is.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On only having 4-6 hours for sleep in guiding two companies in June 2011.]  Most people have major positions at companies and they’re also raising families.  They have two year olds.  I have it easy.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
That’s one of our biggest challenges – getting the people to the product immediately in a consistent way.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2011] I mean, what is Twitter?  Ask 100 people, ‘what is the world?’ and you’ll get a thousand different answers.  The same is true for Twitter.  It’s different things to different people.  Twitter is the world.
<BR><a href="jack-dorsey-quotes.html">Jack Dorsey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The constraint of 140 characters is easy to approach and consume, without a great deal of barriers to entry.  One message and suddenly the whole world has access to that Tweet.
