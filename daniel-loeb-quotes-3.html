<BR>
<BR>
[In April 2009] It is astonishing how many attractive opportunities we are able to find in these areas, even after the market’s rally.  
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2009] It is been my experience that the most compelling part of the distressed cycle is the later stage, involving restructuring of defaulted securities.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009] Our investment in Dana began as a classic event-driven, distressed play in the US auto space that transformed into a stake in an undervalued, well-capitalized company completing a massive operational restructuring.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009] In 2007, we made profitable investments in the mortgage sector by betting on the decline in subprime indices and single name securities.  By early 2009, unprecedented forced selling and fear had driven the market in structured mortgage securities so low that we believed the next move would be upward, despite negative underlying economic trends and headlines.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009] It is disappointing to not that many of the ‘solutions’ the government has proposed to our problems amount to nothing more than kicking the can down the road, leaving significant structural issues for the (not so distant) future.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009] As investors, it is our job to focus on actionable investment ideas and thus monetary and fiscal policy, trade, stimulus, healthcare and financial industry reform, energy policy, infrastructure initiatives, online gambling, and education are all areas where we rely on astute political analysis to predict eventual winners and losers.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2009] While I have never professed to have a crystal ball that forecasts market direction, I can make one prediction with certainty: it is a bull market in government regulation and intervention.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2010 on issues such as ‘peak oil’, and climate change.] It is difficult to predict which of these ‘monsters in the closet’ will reveal themselves and when (just as it was difficult to predict when the sub-prime crisis would come home to roost)…
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2010] We have also avoided many consensus trades, including cyclical and commodity stocks, gold, Chinese and other emerging markets, all of which were terrific performers for other funds last year but do not meet our framework or qualify as part of the knitting we do best and to which we are sticking.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2010] Sentiment is usually backward looking and is incorrect so frequently that it is often used by professionals as a counter indicator of market direction.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2010] ‘Main Street’ is not independent of Wall Street.  We are each part of an intricate ecosystem and the failure to lay out clear rules of the road in intellectually honest tones is beginning to show signs of sabotaging the overall recovery.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2010] We love the stocks we own even if we cannot predict the timing in which they will appreciate.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2010] For part of our portfolio we are value investors and must look past short term market swings through to a time when these valuations will be recognized by the market or potential acquirers.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2010] Many people see the collapse of the sub-prime markets, along with the failure and subsequent rescue of many banks, as failures of capitalism rather than a result of a vile stew of inept management, unaccountable boards of directors, and overmatched regulators not just asleep, but comatose, at the proverbial switch.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2010] As capital allocators, it is important to remain dispassionate amid the volatility.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2010] We use stories to make sense of the complex and the incomprehensible, to fill in the gaps, and to give ourselves peace of mind.  
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2010] The desire to create a story that emancipates one from blame and promises future forecasting precision must be incredibly powerful for any public servant charged with the awesome responsibilities of the Fed Chairman.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2010] From an investor’s point of view, our challenge is not only to keep up with rapidly unfolding events around the world, but also to keep our perspective fresh and differentiated from that of our competitors.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2010] If we are honest with ourselves and our colleagues, remain attentive to our own biases and deceptions, focus on process, attempt to understand why we erred, and engage in deliberate practice and self-observation to improve our decision making ability, we will not only minimize our errors, but also ultimately become better people and better investors.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2011] Employ a dispassionate analytical framework which allows us to capitalize on the irrational fluctuations of the herd.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thanks very much for setting expectations way too high.
<BR><a href="daniel-loeb-quotes.html">Daniel Loeb<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think you need to be a little bit of a philosopher to be a good investor.
