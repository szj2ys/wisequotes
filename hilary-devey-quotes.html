[On declaring that she would never end up like her father at the age of seven and going on to build Pall-Ex] I didn’t.  the drive that was sparked into life in that moment is what’s seen me through the last fifty years of ups and downs – with a h*ll of a lot of hard graft in between.  It’s helped me build a business with an annual turnover of 100 million pounds in the UK and Ireland alone, providing jobs for 7,500 people across nine countries.

<BR>
<BR>
[On the idea that helped create Pall-Ex] I heard him say that they could do a delivery to Scotland but it would not get there until the following Wednesday.  For me, coming from a parcels background, that was like going back 20 to 30 years.  I asked the haulier why he couldn’t deliver until the next Wednesday and he said it would not be cost-effective until they could fill a whole vehicle.  I thought ‘There has to be an easier way than this.’
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On recruiting hauliers to her network] I set myself certain criteria – the members had to be financially solvent and they had to have certain operational standards.  I think some thought: ‘Who is this madwoman, what is she talking about?’ My system gave them the luxury of telling their customers that they could deliver their pallets the next day.  I sold the concept to them on the idea of ‘every postcode, every day.’
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her first logistical hub for Pall-Ex] It had no running water, no electricity and chemical loos.
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I wrote operational procedures and made members abide by them.  If they didn’t, I expelled them from the network.  After I had done that once, they knew I meant business and that I would not compromise my standards.  The ethos of the company is that they treat other’s freight as they would treat their own.  It’s really strictly enforced.
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m very straight-talking and I think hauliers respond to that.  They may not like me, but hopefully I’ve earned their respect now.
