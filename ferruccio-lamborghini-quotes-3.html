<BR>
[On Nuccio Bertone] I don’t know whether Bertone embodied the Lamborghini spirit better than the others but I know for sure that, thanks to us, he found ‘a shoe that fit him,’ as he told me on the day we introduced the Miura at the 1965 Turin Automobile Show.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The Miura was six years in production, and it surpassed our wildest hopes.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Miura and racing] I know sports enthusiasts all over the world who would have paid a king's ransom for a racing version. But I always refused to build one. This was not to avoid doing battle with Ferrari, as people have claimed, but out of a father's concern. My son Tonino was sixteen years old when I created the Lamborghini and I knew that a competition environment would attract him irresistibly toward racing which was a circumstance I feared, so I included in the company's bylaws a prohibition against race participation. 
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1970, when the first anti-pollution laws were passed in the United States, we realized that the poor Miura was condemned to death.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Miura and the United States anti-pollution laws] At the plant we had brainstormed the problem from every possible point of view. But finally we had to admit that it was impossible to house that devilish device known as a catalytic converter and the bag of other required American gadgets in the limited space under the Miura’s hood which was just large enough to hold the carburettors and their filters.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I've often been asked why I named the car Miura. To answer that question I have to go back to the birth of the company. In 1962, I visited Eduardo Miura’s ranch in Seville where he raised bulls for bullfighting, and I was so impressed that by the time I got home I had already selected my future emblem. The fact also that I was born under the sign of Taurus sort of ratified my decision.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1984] I still miss the Miura. No one has ever equalled it.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The 1973 oil crisis was about to shake the automobile world… The golden age was over. To survive we launched the Countach and the Urraco. In 1970 I had chosen to sell fifty-one percent of my stock. I sold the rest in 1972.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I became interested in vine growing, studied the subject and invested in a vineyard that I created from nothing on the banks of Lake Trasimeno in Umbria. My son and I produce Sangue di Miura (Blood of Miura) a wine that is our pride and joy. My friends tell me that I've grown younger. One thing is certain, I've never lost any of my enthusiasm. But times have changed.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m enjoying the peace and quiet of my vineyard. And when I miss the sound and the fury, I take refuge in my garage and turn the key in the ignition of my Miura. Just long enough to make the needle move.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1984 on Museo Lamborghini (The Lamborghini Museum)] A museum that a now being built under my son's supervision. A museum dedicated to the dream Lamborghinis. It will shortly open its doors in Bologna.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
For the rest of my life I'll feel happy whenever I look at my Miura. This car left its mark on its age, and I say that nobody has built anything better since.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1984 on the Miura] It was the first car of our wildest dreams, a car for absolute fanatics. We refused to make a single technical compromise in the Miura. Mounting the engine transversely in the center was a daring step in itself, one that no one had ever dared to try. As for its appearance, you can judge for yourself nineteen years later.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The 350 was my first creation - It dates from 1963, but you have to admit that it has aged much better than many of its competitors. Especially in the coachwork designed by Touring. One kilometer in 27 seconds, start to finish!
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Enzo Ferrari] He just wasn't willing to listen to my suggestions…
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Lamborghini 350] It was comfortable and luxurious but, thanks to its traditional architecture, it was also reassuring. For me, it was the best reliability-performance compromise of its day. It was superior to the GT of my Maranello competitor.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The 400 model was merely a logical development of the 350. Touring succeeded magnificently in lengthening the body without making it heavier. With the 400, our customers had a real 2 + 2 with very healthy behavior. The engine of the 400 resembled that of the 350 for line, but it had a 4-liter capacity instead of the 3.5 liters of our first creation. It's a shame that Touring closed its doors shortly thereafter - we liked its work very much.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The Islero as a logical successor to the 400 GT a great classic and very traditional in its body, designed by Marazzi
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The Espada was the Lamborghini of the mature man, the next step after Miura.
<BR><a href="ferruccio-lamborghini-quotes.html">Ferruccio Lamborghini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One thing is certain, I've never lost any of my enthusiasm…

Bonus Lamborghini Quotes:
<BR>
<BR>
If we don’t make mistakes then we will never make something new. <BR><B>Gianpaolo Dallara</B> [Lamborghini Engineer]
<BR>
<BR>
[On Ferruccio Lamborghini saying no initially to racing] I hoped we would go racing, because I feel that racing helps the development of this type of car.  But if we had divided things up at that early stage, they would have gone out of control.  It would have been sheer insanity. 
<BR><B>Bob Wallace</B> [Lamborghini test driver]
<BR>
<BR>
Just like he had done on all the other Lamborghinis, my father took the name from a tauromachy (bullfighting) book.  He really liked bulls, both as a symbol – The Tauris was his star sign – and as an animal, strong and brave.  Urraco is the name of a race of little but fierce fighting bulls, black and white, as the Spanish dictionary says, it is a ‘toro de pelaje negro con manchas blancas.’ Meaning a black bull with white spots. – <BR><B>Tonino Lamborghini</B> [Son of Ferruccio Lamborghini]
