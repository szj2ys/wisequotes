It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.  I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of it’s creed.  We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> [As a child his parents insisted that instead of hating white people, it was his Christian duty to love them] How could he?  How could I love a race of people who hated me and who had been responsible for breaking me up with one of my best childhood friends?<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> [On not retaliating to an incident when he was 8 years old where a white women slapped him who alleged that he had stepped on her foot.]  I think some of it was part of my native structure.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> My call to the ministry was not a miraculous or supernatural something.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> [On praising Reinhold Niebuhr’s work for helping him to] Recognize the illusions of a superficial optimism concerning human nature and the dangers of a false idealism.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> [Gandhi was] probably the first person in history to lift the love ethic of Jesus above mere interaction between individuals to a powerful and effective social force.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> The length of life as we shall use it, is not it’s duration not it’s longevity.  It is rather the push of a life forward to it’s personal welfare.  The breadth of a life is the outward concern for the welfare of others.  The height of a life is the upward reach toward God.  These are the three dimensions of life and, without the due development of all, no life becomes complete.  Life at its best is a great triangle.  At one angle stands the individual person, at the other angle stands other persons, and at the top stands God.  Unless these three are concatenated, working harmoniously together in a single life, that life is incomplete.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> If we are to go forward we must go back and rediscover… that all reality has spiritual control.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>[At a high school speech in April 13, 1944] … Let us see to it that increasingly… we give fair play and free opportunity for all people.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> I’ve been to the mountaintop.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> I can’t make myself to believe that God wants me to hate.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> [That eventful day would] Go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> One hundred years later, the Negro still is not free; one hundred years later the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> With this heritage, it is not surprising that I had learned to abhor segregation, considering it both rationally inexplicable and morally unjustifiable.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> The church must become increasingly active in social action outside its doors.  It must seek to keep channels of communication open between the Negro and the white community.  It must take an active stand against the injustice that Negroes confront in housing, education, police protection, and in city and state courts.  It must exert its influence in the area of economic justice.  As guardian of the moral and spiritual life of the community the church cannot look with indifference upon these glaring evils.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> I still believe that we shall overcome.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> [He would not pay a fine] For an act that I did not commit and above all for brutal treatment that I did not deserve.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> [He would see the insides of many more jail cells and courtrooms in his struggle to] Wipe out the scourge of brutality and violence inflicted upon Negroes who seek only to walk with dignity before God and man.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>[On his family home] A very congenial home situation, [where] love was central.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> [On the death of his grandmother] This is why today I am such a strong believe in personal immortality.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> I came to see that God had placed a responsibility upon my shoulders.  [Non violent action would lead to] The creation of the beloved community, [while the] aftermath of violence is tragic bitterness.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> [He went to many places in Boston that advertised rooms for rent but] They were for rent until they found out I was a Negro, and suddenly they had just been rented.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> [To Marry Powell a married friend studying at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston] Do you know any nice, attractive young ladies?<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> Non violence is the answer.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> If we are to have peace on earth, our loyalties must become ecumenical [(Worldwide or general in influence)] rather than sectional.  Our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class, and our nation; and this means we must develop a world perspective.  No individual can live along; no nation can live alone, and as long as we try, the more we are going to have war in this world.  Now the judgment of God is upon us, and we must either, learn to live together as brothers or we are going to perish together as fools.  <BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> No individual can live along; no nation can live alone, and as long as we try, the more we are going to have war in this world.  <BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> Not long after talking about that dream, I started seeing it turn into a nightmare.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> If they let us march, they admitted their lie that the black man was content.  If they shot us down, they told the world they were inhuman brutes.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>The policy-makers… have caused the darkness: they created discrimination, they created slums; they perpetuate unemployment, ignorance, and poverty.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> The slums… are the handiwork of a vicious system… Negroes live in them, but they do not make them, any more than a prisoner makes a prison.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> It is not the race per se that we fight, but the policies and ideology that leaders of that race have formulated to perpetuate oppression.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> Nothing in our glittering technology can raise man to new heights, because material growth has been made an end in itself, and, in the absence of moral purpose, man himself becomes smaller as the works of man become bigger.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> Growth requires connection and trust.  Alienation is a form of living death.  It is the acid of despair that dissolves society.  <BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> There is nothing wrong with a traffic law which says you have to stop for a red light.  But when a fire is raging, the fire-truck goes right through that red light, and normal traffic had better get out of its way.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> A life is sacred.  Property is intended to serve life, and no matter how much we surround it with rights and respect, it has no personal being.  It is part of the earth man walks on, it is not man.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> I still have a dream today that one day justice will roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.  I still have a dream today that in all our state houses and city halls men will be elected to go there who will do justly and love mercy and walk humbly with their God… With this faith we will be able to speed up the day when there will be peace on earth and goodwill toward men.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> The Negro slave, denied education, dehumanized, imprisoned on cruel plantations, knew that far to the North a land existed where a fugitive slave, if he survived the horrors of the journey, could find freedom.  The legendary Underground Railroad started in the South and ended in Canada.  The freedom road links us together.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> The Underground Railroad could not bring freedom to many Negroes.  Heroic though it was, even the most careful research cannot reveal how many it liberated.  Yet it did something far greater.  It symbolized hope when freedom was almost an impossible dream.  Our spirit never died even though the weight of centuries was a crushing burden.<BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">Martin Luther King Jr<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="martin-luther-king-jr-quotes-11.html">11<a/></p><p><BR>
