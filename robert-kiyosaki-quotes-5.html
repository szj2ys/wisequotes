Ironically, I have made more money focusing on serving more people rather than focusing on how to make more money.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>One of the big differences between an S [Self employed] and B [Business] quadrant person is the number of customer they can handle.  If you want to be rich, simply serve more people.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The most successful businesses usually do one of two things a) Solve a problem or b) Fill a need.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>In my reality a winner also know when to quit.  Sometimes in life, it is best to cut your losses.  It is best to admit you have come to a dead end or to admit you have been barking up the wrong tree.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>In my opinion, a quitter is someone who quits simply because things have gotten tough.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>You can always quit.  Why start now?<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Be optimistic as well as brutally honest with yourself.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Since the banks can print money, why can’t you?<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>In spite of rising unemployment and the loss of traditionally safe jobs, like a monkey clinging to his fruits and nuts, people are returning back to school to train for a new job, higher pay, benefits and a good pension plan.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time.  For example you cannot have two cars in a one-car garage.  The same is true with thoughts and ideas.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Taking action is important because we learn by our mistakes.  The idea that mistakes are bad is a bad idea.  If people do not make mistakes, they fail to learn.  Which is why my poor dad remained poor.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>With high-quality financial education, money flows in rather than out.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Start small, dream big.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Know that you will make mistakes, so make small mistakes, learn and keep dreaming big.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>In the world of money and financial education, cashflow is the single most important world.  Cash is always flowing.  It is either flowing in, or it is flowing out.  For most people, they work hard and the cash flows out.  True financial education trains you to have cash flowing in.  Financially educated investors must know the difference between cashflow and capital gains.  Most uneducated investors invest for capital gains.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>You have to be very smart to invest for cashflow.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>As a couple, what is our unfair advantage?  First, we set our financial goals together.  Second, we study and we learn together in order to achieve the goal’s we’ve set.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>There is a lot of truth to the old saying: Birds of a feather flock together.  In my experience, people in different quadrants do not like people in other quadrants.  Different quadrants attract different people, generally people with the same values and attitudes.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Tax laws… these are not inadvertent loopholes in the law we are talking about.  They are intentional benefits for business owners and investors.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Kim and I invest 90% of the time for cash flow, aka passive income.  When we do invest for capital gains, aka portfolio income, we are extremely cautious, because we know it is gambling.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Cash must keep flowing.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>I was facing the nightmare that keeps most investors out of real estate: property management and negative cash flow.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Remember it is not the asset class that determines if something (a house, boat, business, oil or gold) is an asset or a liability.  What determines if something is an asset is the direction of the cashflow.  If cashflows into your pocket it’s an asset.  If cashflows out of your pocket, it’s a liability.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>This is our objective: We want our down payment back, a free asset, free cashflow and tax breaks.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Value is always based on the net cash flow.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>In their avoidance of risk, people lead lives of extreme risk.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Weaker currency means inflation at home.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>There is no such thing as a safe investment.  There are only smart investors.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Today, there are more mutual-fund companies than there are publicly traded companies.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Betting your future on the ups and downs of any market is risky, very risky.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>The more you know about the different asset classes, the more your control goes up and your risk goes down.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The ability to sell, manage debt, and analyse market trends is essential to all four asset classes.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Sales equals income.  If you want more income, learn to sell.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>A business creates most of the truly wealthy people, but a business takes the most financial education.  Real estate requires the second highest financial education.  Paper assets are easy to get into, but are the riskiest.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The rich don’t work for money.  They focus on assets that produce cashflow in good times or bad.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The rich focus on the asset column.  They know if they focus on assets first, expenses and liabilities will be handled.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Today when we want a new liability, may be a new car or vacation house, all we have to do is acquire or develop an asset first, and that asset will pay for the liability.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Entrepreneurs turn problems into profits.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The only difference between the world monkey and money is the letter ‘k’ which stands for ‘knowledge’, or in the case of the monkey, the lack of knowledge.  Without knowledge, there is not much difference between a monkey with money and a monkey without money.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Five things happen to people who do not invest, or who invest poorly: 1) They work hard all their lives 2) They worry about money all their lives 3) They depend on others, such as family, a company pension, or the government to take care of them 4) The boundaries of their lives are defined by money 5) They will not know what true freedom is.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-6.html">6<a/> </p><p><BR>
