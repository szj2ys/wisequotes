He must fear that his loss may develop into a much bigger loss, and hope that his profit may become a big profit.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>A man may beat a stock or a group at a certain time, but no man living can beat the stock market!<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>A man may beat a horse race, but he cannot beat horse racing.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>A trader gets to play the game as the professional billard player does – that is, he looks far ahead instead of considering the particular shot before him.  It gets to be an instinct to play for position.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>Don’t sell stocks when the sap is running up the trees!<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>I’ve seen a rumour about myself grow so that the fellow who started it did not recognise it when it came back to him in twenty-four hours, swollen with new and picturesque details.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>I suppose it is the contagion of example that makes a man do something because everybody around him is doing the same thing.  Perhaps it is some phase or variety of the herd instinct.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>That is one trouble about trading on a large scale.  You cannot sneak out as you can when you pike along.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>You cannot always sell out when you wish or when you think it wise.  You have to get out when you can; when you have a market that will absorb your entire line.  Failure to grasp the opportunity to get out may cost you millions.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>A man must be on the lookout so alertly that when his chance sticks in it’s head at his door he must grab it.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>I get my pleasure out of matching my brains against the brains of other traders – men whom I have never seen and never talked to and never advised to buy or sell and never expect to meet or know.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>A man cannot be convinced against his own convictions, but he can be talked into a state of uncertainty and indecision, which is even worse, for that means that he cannot trade with confidence and comfort.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>I ceased to do my own thinking.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>I naturally think that if it is wrong to be bearish it must be right to be a bull.  And if it is right to be a bull it is imperative to buy.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>I am not timid as a rule, but I got to feeling nervous and that made me decide to lighten my load.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>The cotton showed me a loss and I kept it.  The wheat showed me a profit and I sold it out.  It was an utterly foolish play…<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>Of all speculative blunders there are few greater than trying to average a losing game.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>Always sell what shows you a loss and keep what shows you a profit.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>Everyday I would buy cotton, more cotton.  And why do you think I bought it?  To keep the price from going down!  If that isn’t a supersucker play, what is?<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>I simply kept on putting up more and more and more money – more money to lose eventually.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>A man can make foolish plays for no reason whatever.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>Another dangerous enemy to a trader is his susceptibility to the urgings of a magnetic personality when plausibly expressed by a brilliant mind.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>Fate does not always let you fix the tuition fee.  She delivers the educational wallop and presents her own bill, knowing you have to pay it, not matter what the amount may be.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>I had been a millionaire rather less than a year.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>I sold my two yachts and was decidedly less extravagant in my manner of living.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>Luck was against me.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>The hope of making the stock market pay your bills is one of the most prolific sources of loss in Wall Street.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>He was a tall thin man with black hair and a hungry look, due to his never going out to lunch for fear of missing something on the tape.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>There isn’t a man in Wall Street who has not lost money trying to make the market pay for an automobile or a bracelet or a motorboat or a painting.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>I could build a huge hospital with the birthday presents that the tight-fisted stock market has refused to pay for.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Of all hoodoos in Wall Street I think the resolve to induce the stock market to act as a fairy godmother is the busiest and most persistent.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>What does a man do when he sets out to make the stock market pay for a sudden need?  Why he merely hopes.  He gambles.  He therefore runs much greater risks than he would if he were speculating intelligently, in accordance with opinions or beliefs logically arrived at after a dispassionate study of underlying conditions.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>He is after an immediate profit.  He cannot afford to wait.  The market must be nice to him at once if at all.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>I kept on trading – and losing.  I persisted in thinking that the stock market must perforce make money for me in the end.  But the only end in sight was the end of my resources.  I went into debt, not only to my principal brokers but to other houses that accepted business from me without my putting up an adequate margin.  I not only go in debt but I stayed in debt from then on.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>There I was, once more broke, which was bad, and dead wrong in my trading which was a sight worse.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>I was sick, nervous, upset and unable to reason calmly.  That is I was in the frame of mind in which no speculator should be when he is trading.  Everything went wrong with me.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>I can’t describe to you how weaponless I felt.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>Broke again and incapable of assuming the offensive vigorously.  In debt and wrong!<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>After all those long years or successes, tempered by mistakes that really served to pay the way for greater successes, I was now worse off than when I began.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR>I had learned a great deal about the game of stock speculation, but I had not learned quite so much about the play of human weaknesses.<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/><BR><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="jesse-livermore-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="jesse-livermore-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="jesse-livermore-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="jesse-livermore-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="jesse-livermore-quotes-6.html">6<a/> </p><p><BR>
