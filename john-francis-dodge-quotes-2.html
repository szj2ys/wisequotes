We were born out on North Fifth Street in a little wooden cottage, close to where your standpipe is located.  In those days we were the most destitute kids in the town.  Poor mother, how she used to worry about her boys.  I am three years older than my brother and naturally mother always confided her trouble in me.  When cold weather came and H. E. and myself were obliged to go barefooted and wear ragged clothes, we didn’t grumble, but tried to make mother think it was all right.

[In August 1913 giving a gift of $100,000 to the city of Niles to build a park honouring their parents] This amount sounds big but really is nothing to us now.  H. E. and myself are worth $50 million and we have made the most of it in the last 10 years.  We want to do something for Niles right away and I had suggested a donation of $100,000.  We will double this amount if your citizens will advance a judicial manner in which it can be spent.   [But the city of Niles rejected the gift after its members questioned the need for a park and determined that the city might have to spend money to maintain it.]
