[In November 2009] There is something strange in that the make-up of most hedge fund people, successful ones. The person has a real interest in making this world a better place than when they got into it. I don’t want to promote the business that much, but I definitely feel that that’s the case.

[On Gold in January 2010] It’s less a supply-demand situation and more a psychological one – better a psychiatrist to invest in gold than me.
<BR><a href="julian-robertson-quotes.html">Julian Robertson<a/>

[In March 2010 on giving $10.2 million to help advance the use of cord blood as a therapy.] Dr. [Joanna] Kurtzberg's research reflects the kind of transformational science that has the potential to change the lives of thousands of people throughout the country and around the world.

[In 2010 on him originally spending time in New Zealand] I was really escaping a job I wanted to change…

[In December 2011] The hedge fund business is getting tougher because there are more hedge funds being created an the reason for that is it’s the best way to pay these very competent guys on Wall Street, so they matriculate into hedge funds.

In general, when people first join the firm they are assigned to senior professionals whom they work with for the next two, three, or four years.  They get the grunt work of ratios and statistical stuff. But that can change fairly quickly.  If they are successful, the promotion rate is very quick.  We had a thirty-year-old president at one time, so people get very important positions quite soon.  I think that is why so many people like the hedge-fund industry.

Julian’s impact will be felt on the hedge fund industry for years to come.  He created a factory of sorts that, instead of making widgets, make great money managers.
