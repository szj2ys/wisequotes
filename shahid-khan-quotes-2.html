<BR>
I wanted to listen, learn, watch and then let the year run and to the right thing.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I felt strongly that we wanted somebody with a great football mind, who’d make it their mission to succeed.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was going to have a hard time looking myself in the mirror because I knew what we had to do.  There was just no two ways about it.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can’t help but learn.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We’re… off to a record start on season ticket sales in Jacksonville even though we have raised prices and had a 2-14 season.  We expect to have record season ticket sales.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2013] Another thing which is interesting, we allowed people to bring kids under 34 inches tall in for free.  We also allowed water and food in free.  You’d be amazed that our per capita sales of food and drink went up.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2013 on how per capita sales of food and drink went up when they allowed fans to bring it in for free.] It’s very simple.  People brought in food, and you attract a certain budget crowd.  ‘I can go to the games, and you don’t have to take a babysitter, I can take my son with me.’  And then you’re attracting a crowd that says ‘I’m not going to buy the $5 hotdog, I’m going to buy the $9 beer.’  A lot of the business moves sound counter-intuitive but they turned out really well.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The high revenue teams are the ones that overall have success.  Green Bay is #4 in revenue and people think it’s a small town in Wisconsin.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You’ve got to give people a reason to spend money and they think it’s good value.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On whether teams are having success because they’re making money or making money because they’ve had success.]  I think it’s the proverbial chicken or the egg.  But you can’t throw your hands up and say I’m not having success on the field, so I’m not going to try on the revenue side.  I think we’ve proven that a 2-14 team can do <BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We are respecting the customers, the fans coming to the stadium, making sure they have a good experience.  And then doing our best to win on the field.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It can’t be that you have to win to get revenue, you have to work on both at the same time.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2013] Football is about as popular as it can be in the US.  The upside, the expansion and growth lies overseas.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2013] Eventually I think all 32 clubs, their goal is to grow the game overseas and London is the logical place to do it.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2013 on NFL expansion to London] Bob Kraft is very bullish on London, and I’m very bullish on London.  But the timing is, we don’t know when.  Is it five years, is it ten years?  When the market develops, that’s when it happens.  
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1991 on Toyota and not learning more on engineering low cost bumpers but on running a bumper factory it was a different story.]  There was nothing Toyota could teach us.  We benchmarked ourselves against the American industry.  I don’t think we knew how bad we were.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1991 on Toyota’s question in September 1989.] Their question was, ‘Is there something inherently Japanese about he system?  Or is it possible to export it.?’
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1991 on consulting with Toyota when problems arise.] They call it open kimono discussion.  I call it no kimono.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2009] Smaller fuel-efficient vehicles is what we need.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2009] I think these are definitely tough times, but the strong will survive.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2009] we’ve been ahead of the curve on consolidating plants, cutting jobs, laying people off.  We don’t want to, but we have to survive.  The key think you want is work.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2009 on such things as the auto industry accounting for almost 20 percent of advertising sales.] The auto industry is more valuable to America than people realize.  It really has been the silent giant.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011] I think our goal is to make it work in Jacksonville.  We want the fans to support us.  And we want to support Jacksonville.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012 On having stands filled with people wearing ‘Fake’ look alike moustaches.] I felt great.  What a tremendous complement.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On reconnecting with the community in order to get customers.] Going out and talking to people…  There’s no substitute for that.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My money is secondary.  The most important thing is energy in the stadium.  [On the fans] We want them to get out of their couches, come here for that energy.  More importantly we need them for our players.  That’s the home field advantage.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012 on the Jacksonville Jaguars and teams.] The best advice I’ve gotten from the owners is – ‘Run it like a business.’… ‘Don’t treat it as a hobby… Be very objective.  And run it like your other business.’  
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
This is football business.  Some of the principles in business that work to make you successful are going to apply here also.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The second piece of advice I got was ‘There’s always second guessing on every decision… You just do what you think is right.’
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012] We have to really expand the fan base.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I think internationally is a huge opportunity for Jacksonville.  Overseas Jacksonville is not well known… We become international.  Let Jacksonville use the power of the NFL to help Jacksonville… I think being international is absolutely vital.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012] NFL is going to go international.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012 on his feeling for NFL going international.] I think there’s huge appetite for it.  But they want the real product.  They don’t want a diluted product.  
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On believing his ‘American Dream’.] No.  Since the second morning I arrived in ‘67 and I started cleaning dishes, I’ve been pinching myself okay.  This is too good.  I mean it can’t get any better… You get up every morning and there’s something else.  
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You feel turbocharged…. I didn’t even know this next plain existed.  
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m totally committed to Jacksonville.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A superbowl of cricket.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] You learn to love the sport.  It’s a three dimensional kind of chess, First you come in as a spectator, but I’ll never forget watching… No matter how many times he was hit, the guy kept going.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You watch those game on a Sunday and then during the week, in your own life, you have some sort of obstacle.  I reflected back and thought: ‘You can’t give up.’  It provides some kind of inspiration.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] It was only about six years ago when I thought, I have developed a love and affection as a fan for the sport and I’d like to be part of it.
