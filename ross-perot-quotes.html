People have been trying to get me to buy sports teams for years.  I always ask, ‘How much does it cost, and how much does it make?’  The place gets real quiet in a hurry.

<BR>
<BR>
As a young man I wanted to be a pearl.  Unfortunately, my lot in life is to be the grain of sand that irritates the oyster.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When you’re on top you tend to be vulnerable.  When you don’t have to hunt anymore, some kids knocks you off.  Keep yourself in shape by climbing the mountain.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Reward workers while the sweat’s still on their brow.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>

I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>

<BR>
Any activist is the guy who cleans the rivers, not the guy who concludes it’s dirty.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It takes five years to develop a new car in this country.  Heck, we won World War II in four years.

<BR>
<BR>
The day I made Eagle Scout was more important to me than the day I discovered I was a billionaire.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Failures are like skinned knees – painful but superficial.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On becoming wealthy] It’s kind of like Halley’s Comet.  It just comes around every so often and hits somebody.  It happened to have hit me.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From my point of view, the less publicity the better.  No publicity at all is the ideal.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Making all this money is partly an accident.  I could have put the same amount of energy into a corporation that made steel forgings, but I would have been in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I had an opportunity to be in the right place, and I have an obligation to do something creative.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
All my cars are GM, and I bargained with the dealer over every one of them.  You gotta watch your money.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t want to leave a vast estate to my children – I don’t want to deny them the advantages I had, which come from making your own way in the world.  Consequently, I’m not leaving them anything – except, I hope, a better America in which they can make their way.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A man is never more on trial than in a moment of excessive good fortune.

<BR>
[To Steve Jobs] If you ever need an investor, call me.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I pick the jockeys, and the jockeys pick the horses and ride them.  You guys are the ones I’m betting on, so you figure it out.

<BR>
<BR>
In terms of a startup company, it’s one that carries the least risk of any I’ve seen in 25 years in the computer industry.  We’ve had some sophisticated people see the hardware – it blew them away.  Steve and his whole NeXT team are the darnedest bunch of perfectionists I’ve ever seen.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
So poor he couldn’t afford to go to college, working in his garage at night, playing with computer chips, which was his hobby, and his dad who looks like a character out of a Norman Rockwell painting – comes in one day and said, ‘Steve, either make something you can sell or go get a job.’  Sixty days later, in a wooden box that his dad made for him, the first Apple computer was created.  And this high school graduate literally changed the world.

<BR>
<BR>
Steve’s [Jobs] like me.  We’re weird in the same way.  We’re soul mates.

<BR>
I am not a legend, but I am a myth.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My mother used to say, ‘Ross, a little of you goes a long way.’  I guess quite a few people today would agree.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We’re all what we were taught to be.  You sit there in that little house in Texarkana and see your mother doing things like (feeding the hungry) when you’re a child, that’s the greatest lesson in the world.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Rockwell painted what I strived to be.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Christmas presents] My father sold a horse to have enough money for presents.  That really bothered me because I knew how he loved that horse.  But it also showed us how much he loved us.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My business success stems mainly from having sat in my dad’s cotton brokerage office, watching him build trust and confidence among the farmers.  After a while he started letting me trade horses and cattle.  I had to buy and sell the same day.  ‘You don’t take ‘em home,’ he said, ‘because then you’ve got to feed ‘em.’  Under his tutelage I learned how to negotiate.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was working jobs like boys did just to make a little money: breaking horses, roofing barns, stringing barbed wire.  If you had stopped me and said, ‘Son, what do you want to do when you grow up?’  I’m sure I would have said I want to get enough education so I can work indoors.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As a boy growing up in Texarkana, Texas, during the Depression, I had many summer jobs, including breaking horses at $1.50 per horse, selling the Saturday Evening Post, selling Christmas cards, selling garden seeds, cutting grass with a manual lawnmower for $1 for a normal-sized yard, roofing barns, digging fence holes and stringing barbed-wire fences.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I threw newspapers for whore houses.  I knew all the women.  I threw papers to flop houses, to some of the poorest people in the world.  They tried to hold me up every Saturday… They weren’t bad people.  They were desperate.  I learned that no matter how poor people are, they’re good people and those are things you can’t learn at Harvard Business School.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On delivering a paper route in a poor neighborhood] I found out that by giving these people good service they paid promptly.  I’d put the paper behind their door.  That was kind of an interesting thing, for them to have a white boy on a horse, whether it was raining or not, bringing the paper to them and giving them the same service white people got.  I had customer loyalty I’ll never have again.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Four years at sea, two years on a destroyer.  Got on at 2 o’clock in the morning, and nine months later I’d gone all the way around the world.  That’s a terrific experience for a boy from Texas who had never been anywhere.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the great blessings is that nobody taught me how to manage people.  Instead, for four years I was taught and shown by example how to lead people.  There is a fundamental difference.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have found the Navy to be a fairly Godless organization.  I do not enjoy the prospect of being subjected to drunken tales of moral emptiness, passing out the penicillin pills and seeing promiscuity on the part of married men.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I loved the Navy, loved the sea, loved ships.  But I always find whatever I’m doing, I’m thoroughly involved in it.  In the Navy, the promotion system and the seniority system and the waiting-in-line system concept were just sort of incompatible with my desire to be measured and judged by what I could produce.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am about as unmilitary as anybody you can find in terms of being informal.  If we hadn’t had a sense of humor when I was growing up, we wouldn’t have made it.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I went to the Naval Academy, I got a short haircut and liked it.  It’s efficient.  You don’t have to waste time combing it.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Opinion of business suits] Camouflage for the corporate jungle.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People wrote I shop at K-Mart .  I’m in and out of K-Mart.  I’m in and out of Sears.  I’m in and out of Penney’s.  I’m in and out of Neiman-Marcus.  Someone wrote that at the Churchill dinner my tuxedo didn’t look as good as Prince Charles!  I bought it off the rack, but I had it pressed.  I thought it looked all right.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Historically in our country, the individual who makes the money has to be a cartoon character.  We’re stuck with that.
<BR><a href="ross-perot-quotes.html">Ross Perot<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Talking about myself is sort of a waste of time.  I’ve lived only one life.  It’s been over documented.  Half of it is truth.  Half of it is myth.  I would think readers are probably sick of it.  I’m sick of it.
