<BR>
<BR>
I’ve had a penchant for buying companies with top-quality brands and rarely minded adopting a more prestigious name for our company.  Our corporate identity changed many times over the years as we ‘rented’ one moniker after another before latching on to the next superior brand.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
[On building Citigroup] The company resembled no other financial institution in the world with its global reach, extensive products, and diversified distribution capabilities.  We had broken every mold in conceiving this great company.

[On doing deals] Let’s not waste a lot of time and let’s get the thing done.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can’t stop looking ahead, thinking a little bit about doing something differently.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You’ve got to look at something as a building block for the future.  Not the end in itself, but as a way to create a new future.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t view anything we have done, any acquisition, any achievement, as an end, only as a building block for the future.  We always get to a point and throw the rope out a little further and then throw it out a little further again.  You can’t stop doing that.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I tried harder because of the discipline and competition.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I remember thinking that if I had $10,000, I could buy all the stocks that I’d ever want to buy.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Citigroup as chairman in 2000] Our core competency is acquisitions.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve had plenty of failed merger negotiations and have made my share of mistakes over the years, but there’s one thing I learned early: Don’t dwell on defeat.  Usually, a better deal has a way of coming along.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Always being prepared for the next deal had explained much of my success over the years…
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We have to give everybody more stock.  They have to have more fun around here.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his evolution as a businessman] My original interest was retail when we started the company, retail customers.  But then it broadened out into doing research and then it broadened out into doing investment banking.  Then it broadened out into trying to build the company rather than just working on deals for other clients.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being third in the line to the CEO - A] Deputy dog.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the relationship between himself and John Reed at the end] It was very tense.  I think we tried to make it less tense, but obviously it was tense and nobody knew what was going to happen.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the directors asked John to go in and then one of them asked me to go int and they asked me some questions.  It was obviously a very emotional time and John was a perfect gentleman.  He was extremely cooperative, a great gentleman.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m a lot happier with John [Reed] in the organization than not.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>

[On his name Sanford I. Weill not having any actual name for the ‘I’] How did it happen?  Maybe the same way it happened to Harry S. Truman.  My mother wanted to name me after somebody whose name started with an ‘I’, but she couldn’t think of a name she liked.  So she gave me the initial with the idea that after I was 21 I could choose whatever middle name I wanted.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On attending the Peekskill Military Academy] The academy was great for me.  The discipline was important and the success I had there did give me a lot of confidence.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On deciding on Cornell over Harvard when he had decided to study engineering in 1951] It had an engineering school and Harvard didn’t.
<BR><a href="sandy-weill-quotes.html">Sandy Weill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I didn’t know that savings banks didn’t allow you to write checks.  That’s how much I knew.
