Horace Elgin Dodge Quotes and other Dodge Quotes
<BR>
<BR>
[On Kahn the architect not supervising Malow Brothers, the contractor in building his home] I must say that I am thoroughly disgusted with them.  They seem to think that it makes no difference with them whether they finish the work this year or next so long as they get it done.
<BR><B>Horace Elgin Dodge</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1906 on applying unsuccessfully for membership in the prestigious Gross Pointe Country Club and then due to being angry and humiliated buying a large tract of land next to the club and vowing to build an extravagant home that would make the Country Club] Look like a shanty. [Mansion named ‘Rose Terrace’ also had an enormous boathouse and docks for Horace’s yachts and speedboats.]
<BR><B>Horace Elgin Dodge</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his fifth wife (Gregg) Sherwood Dodge when he filed for divorce in 1961] I can’t afford the woman. [Alleging in 1961 that Sherwood Dodge spent $300,000 in one year on jewelry, clothes, and luxuries including two-carat diaper pins for their baby boy.]
<BR><B>Horace Dodge Jr</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[The grandson of John Francis Dodge] I loved my father, who died when I was 10.  He taught me wisdom.  My stepfather Denny… taught me patience.  He was terrific and I loved him too.  My mother was always there.
<BR><B>John Francis Dodge III</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[Frederick Haynes - The man who took over as president of Dodge Brothers on January 1921 after Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge had passed away in 1920] I don’t say that a man’s whole life should consist of business and nothing but business but I do say and I do know that the man who puts his job first is the man who gives the orders in the end.
<BR><B>Frederick Haynes</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 1928] Buying the Dodge [Brothers] was one of the soundest acts of my life.  I say sincerely that nothing we have done for the organization compares with that transaction.  We had, before the merger, an intensely sharp spearhead in the Chrysler Corporation, but when we put behind it all of Dodge our spearhead had a weighty shaft and had become a potent thing.
