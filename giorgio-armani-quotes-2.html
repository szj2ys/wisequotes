<BR>
The new power suit is the confidence you have in yourself.  The clothes just accentuate that.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have always thought that fashion is about evolution and moving forward.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t believe in looking back, referring to, or interpreting the past.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2000] My style has always been about casual, comfortable dressing right since the beginning, 25 years ago.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think it’s important to say that style is not about power and affluence but about comfort and confidence.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The fashion frenzy around Oscar night… is disturbing.  When a star is quizzed about her jewels and dress before her movie, it marginalizes the substance of the occasion.  The relationship needs to be a collaboration and not a slap-dash race to get there before someone else.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
For me, style is an intensely personal quality.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Style is different from fashion in that it is not a trend-based concept.  It’s about confidence, wearing the clothes that really suit your personality, and not trying to be someone you are not.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Designing clothes is absolutely different from standing all day in a department store and seeing the customers’ reactions.  There you do follow the path of the clothes all the way up to the moment when the sales assistants show them to the customers.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In the beginning I was not a real fashion designer, nor was he a real managing director, but we soon learnt.  We were talented and had ideas.  The rest just happened.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On talking about fashion of the 60s and 70s] Those ridiculous miniskirts above those fat legs!  They look like roast piglets.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On getting started] I targeted the jacket, because I felt it didn’t take advantage of its possibilities, didn’t follow the body line.  I pulled it down towards the waist and lifted the shoulders – that made it quite dynamic.  Then I removed the padding and stiffening.  So you already had looseness, but tailoring still had to make up for the lack of drop and padding.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
All of my more important clients secretly think they are fashion designers.  They want to change this, that and the other.  I try to explain that there can only be one designer here and it is me, but I don’t always succeed.  I don’t give way to their pressure… except for a few special occasions when they are able to convince me they are right.  Then I sometimes have to have a wrangle with [Sergio] Galeotti when he attacks one of my designs as unsellable.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am not a creative genius and I am not a marketing genius.  I am not a miracle on the fashion scene.  It became clear to me, after the establishment of the Giorgio Armani label that there was another market out there interested in this style which was younger and had not as much money so, since I was not studying fashion creation on a yacht, I recognised this and created Armani Jeans.  
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On where to sell Armani Jeans] Where to sell it?  That’s how Emporio came about.  Then I realised that the young wanted more than just a pair of jeans and a jacket – and that was because I would be in the shop in via Durini [in Milan] and they would come to me and give me advice.  So it became a collection and the whole idea changed.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I could have become much richer much quicker if I had decided to take advantage of my name by licensing.  The decision not to has meant that every line is successful and there is no confusion, no overlapping.  The identity is clear and controlled.  We financed ourselves every step of the way; I have never had half a lira debt in my life.  I don’t think this Cinderella story could happen now; I am happy it happened to me but the system has changed.  Nowadays there are the big groups which decide who is going to be successful; the press, the industry, finance, it all works together to promote a certain designer.  That is the limit of fashion today and the embarrassment.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
For someone my age, it is an embarrassment; anyone starting out does not know any different.  But I have always liked to fight; I have always fought against the system in a certain sense.  If a certain system exists, even if it is in my interest to belong, I have never wanted to be part of it.  Yes, I have always been a loner.  Obviously I have had a lot of support from the press but I have never really been part of an explosion of a huge celebration of my fashion and my style.  If I have had problems it has been with the media.  Perhaps these subtle changes in my style are not shocking enough.  The press like to be shocked; they like to find something which gives them a shock every season.  They like revolution, big explosions, not evolution.  They just say: Armani is Armani and [he mimed spitting on his hands and swiping them together in a gesture of dismissiveness] wipe their hands.  That’s not good for me.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the fashion media’s hunger for abrupt change] What they all forget, is that we really only have one purpose: to make women and men look better.  And anyway, after an explosion, there’s nothing left, only ashes.  But then there’s another explosion, and more ashes.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The 30s and 40s has always influenced me.  There was an elegant simplicity – clean white blouse, a simple skirt, a duster [coat], a slim lame evening dress.  By the 50s, fashion was getting too extreme.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1992] I wanted to be a country doctor and save lives… like a hero in a Hollywood film.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
[To his models before a show] Remember you are women, not young girls walking down the street… very elegant, very simple and very natural.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Michelle Pfeiffer in 1994] She has an elegance, a simplicity, a purity of character.  She really understands my clothes.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2012 on staying ahead in the current environment with new technology] I care a lot about new technologies, because we see new inventions in the media or online.  I think there are exceptional tools to work with.  We are able to see within a fraction of time how the picture of a model will look.  Before it took an unimaginable amount of time.  All of this has made it feasible to speed up the creative process.  But there are limits with the new technologies as well.  I believe that the hand of a human being is very different from the key on a computer.  I am very loyal to my roots which is from pure design – a pencil and a sketchbook.  But of course where necessary I rely on the latest and most modern technologies.  
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2012 on him dressing Lady Gaga] Lady Gaga is a laugh.  Lady Gaga is someone the younger generation loves very much.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2012] It is my strong conviction that no-one will ever dress in an outfit of Lady Gaga’s.  But maybe they will wear a pair of jeans by the same man who has created a costume for Lady Gaga.                        
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is difficult to find a balance between what people expect me to do and what I must do to keep it fresh.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m not a big connoisseur, but I believe I am a rather sensitive person and I catch atmospheres… Because it’s part of my work… you know, paying attention to this… I don’t know the exact terms…  vocal extension maybe, virtuosity.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2008] I ended up in this profession just by chance.  A series of circumstances brought me into the world of fashion.  I was unhappy about the world that was around me, because since I was very young, I realized that there were things that I didn’t like.  
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Even sometimes when my mother would set up a table, I didn’t like the way she did it.  
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was somehow a victim of destiny.  
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Keep in mind that the goal of your profession, which has been my goal so far, is to improve people’s image through fashion.  
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You must somehow subdue your desire to give free reign to your imagination and try to see your designs on the streets not just on the covers of magazines, not just displayed in fashion shows, but having some kind of follow-up reality.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At a fashion show] I was a bit naughty last night, I was up to 1:30am in bungalow eight.  
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m someone that speaks through his clothing and therefore I let my clothes speak for me.  If somebody is not able to understand my message through my clothes, then they should ask me.  And when I explain, they should write what I say, and not other things.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Nobu restaurant inside his store in central Milan in 2009] I admire Nobu-san’s genius in combining traditional Japanese cuisine with international flavours from South America.  His attention to the aesthetic and detail makes the dining experience unique.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] I’ve always been interested in dressing sports personalities because to me they are like modern gladiators.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2008] You get a lot more rational as the years pass, less emotional, but you always have doubts as to whether the collection will be liked or not.  Every after all these years, I can still never tell.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2008] I have stayed away from doing something that is a surprise, that gives a ‘wow’ effect, and taken more into consideration the fact that I have to dress my clients in such a way that they feel good… Right now is a very difficult time for everyone and so I want to maintain a sense of calm and reassurance with my clothes.  
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2008 on the economic climate] This is the time to take risks.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Emporio Armani shouldn’t just follow the trends but have that special Armani factor.
