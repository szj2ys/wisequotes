<BR>
No matter how gifted a leader is, his gifts will never reach their maximum potential without the application of self-discipline.
<BR><a href="john-maxwell-quotes.html">John Maxwell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Not everyone will become a great leader, but everyone can become a better leader.
<BR><a href="john-maxwell-quotes.html">John Maxwell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way.
<BR><a href="john-maxwell-quotes.html">John Maxwell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Each member of your team has the potential for personal greatness; a leader’s job is to teach them how to do it.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
An effective leader is very good at listening. It’s difficult to listen when you are talking.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
A leader defined by intensity is a stronger leader. A leader ruled by emotions is weak, the team vulnerable.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
The leader’s unending responsibility must be to remove every detour, every barrier to ensure that vision is first clear, and then real.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A company has only so much money and managerial time. Winning leaders invest where the payback is the highest. They cut their losses everywhere else.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Leadership can be taught.
<BR><a href="john-maxwell-quotes.html">John Maxwell<a/>
<BR>

There are very few leadership books; most deal with management.
<BR><a href="john-maxwell-quotes.html">John Maxwell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A leader’s greatness is found in bringing out greatness in others.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
All leaders and their organizations are visited by misfortune and bad luck. You will not be the exception to the rule.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
 “Woe is me” is not the theme song of an effective leader.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Great leaders are rarely ‘realistic’ by other people’s standards. They are, however, accurate and intelligent.
<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When the best leader's work is done the people say, 'We did it ourselves'.
<BR><B>Lao-Tzu</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Show me a country or a company that is not doing well and I'll show you a bad leader.
<BR><B>Joseph E. Brooks</B>
<BR>
<BR>
A leader has to take people from where they are to where they have never been before.
<BR><B>Henry Kissinger</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Whoever accepts mediocrity is a person who makes compromises.  And when the leader makes a compromise, the rest of the company does too.
<BR><B>Charles Knight d'Emerson</B>
<BR>
<BR>
To my mind, the quality of leadership is the single most important ingredient in the recipe for business success.
<BR><B>Harold Geneen</B>

<BR>
<BR>
The superior leader gets things done with very little motion.  He imparts instruction not through many words but through a few deeds.  He keeps informed about everything but interferes hardly at all.  He is a catalyst, and though things would not get done as well if he weren't there, when they succeed he takes no credit.  And because he takes no credit, credit never leaves him.
<BR><B>Lao-Tzu</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Managers prefer to work with people, while leaders arouse emotion in people.
<BR><B>Abraham Zalisnick</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I start with premise that the function of leadership is to produce more leaders, not more followers.
<BR><B>Ralph Nader</B>
<BR>
<BR>
As for the best leaders, the people do not notice their existence.  The next best, the people honour and praise.  The next, the people fear; and the next, the people hate.
<BR><B>Lao-Tzu</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I never associate passion with the word manager, and I’ve never seen a leader without it.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Good business leaders create a vision, articulate the vision, passionately own the vision, and relentlessly drive it to completion.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I firmly believe my job is to walk around with a can of water in one hand and a can of fertilizer in the other and to make things flourish.
<BR><a href="jack-welch-quotes.html">Jack Welch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Trying to lead men from behind makes you a driver and not a leader. 
<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
It is easier to lead men just as it is easier to pull a log chain. You cannot push a log chain and you cannot push troops. The troops will keep running back to you for instructions – really from fear.
<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
A leader has to be ahead of his men. You’ve got to know what is going on all the time.
<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
<BR>
<BR>
You young lieutenants have to realize that your platoon is like a piece of spaghetti. You can’t push it. You’ve got to get out in front and pull it.
<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Leaders are those who have replaced fear with discernment, which means they can predict the inevitable.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A true team leader has a high self esteem, high confidence, empathy – spiritual things that come from someone who is at peace with themselves.
<BR><a href="graham-turner-quotes.html">Graham Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On a shop team] If the leader of that team felt genuine ownership of that business, imagine what a competitor would have to do to knock you off. They would have to be awfully good to attack 20,000 people who vehemently believed that they had ownership in the business.
<BR><a href="graham-turner-quotes.html">Graham Turner<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Big obligations make good leaders. But good leaders also take on big obligations.
<BR><a href="tom-monaghan-quotes.html">Tom Monaghan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and none knows whither he is going. To muster his host and bring it into danger- this may be termed the business of the general.
<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have no complex about wealth. I have worked hard for my money, producing things people need. I believe that the able industrial leader who creates wealth and employment is more worthy of historical notice than politicians and soldiers.
<BR><a href="john-paul-getty-quotes.html">John Paul Getty<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A good demonstration is more effective than a great description.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
A great leader is a teacher who is a lifelong student.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
We are all leaders of something in life. You are a leader. Start leading, and the others will soon follow.
<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/>
