He must know the objective.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> [On being told ‘General, we cannot predict the weather.  We must assume average weather conditions and plan accordingly.’]  We never assume anything is average.  If we do any assuming, we will assume the worst weather.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> I counted over a hundred American armoured fighting vehicles along the road, and as a  result, issued an order… that every tank should be examined and the direction, calibre, and type of hit which put it out made of record, so that we would have data from which to construct a better tank.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> There are more tired division commanders than there are tired divisions.  Tired officers are always pessimists.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> Reports by wounded men are always exaggerated and favor the enemy.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> Infantry troops can attack continuously for sixty hours.  Frequently much time and suffering are saved if they will do so.  Beyond sixty hours, it is rather a waste of time, as the men become too fatigued from lack of sleep.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> Wars are won by knowing what we know.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> We must know exactly what we need for every day.  If we try to carry into combat more gas, oil, supply parts, or anything that we do not need, it could lose a war as quickly as letting a soldier carry a pound more than he needs on his back.  We must cut to the bone because we are going to travel fast.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> The more senior the officer who appears with a very small unit at the front, the better the effect on the troops…<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> Corps and Army Commanders must make it a point to be physically seen by as many individuals of their command as possible – certainly by all combat soldiers.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>Remember that your primary mission as a leader is to see with your own eyes and to be seen by the troops when engaged in personal reconnaissance.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> The more senior the officer, the more time he has.  Therefore, the senior should go forward to visit the junior rather than call the junior back to see him.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> When it is necessary to collect several commanders for the formulation of a coordinated plan… the juniors should report to the superior headquarters.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> My theory is that an army commander does what is necessary to accomplish his mission, and that nearly eighty percent of his mission is to arouse morale in his men.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> Officers must not hesitate to lead.  Before an attack is declared hopeless, the senior officer must lead an attack in person.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> All officers, and particularly General Officers, must be vitally interested in everything that interests the soldier.  Usually you will gain a great deal of knowledge by being interested, but even if you do not, the fact that you appear interested has a very high morale influence on the soldier.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> It’s a hell of a lot more important to keep your feet clean than it is to brush your teeth!<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> You use your feet all the time to get at the enemy.  Keep your feet clean.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> Always capture the highest terrain feature in your vicinity at once, and stay on it.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> You need good enemies as much as you need good friends.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Having the right enemies is more important than having the right friends.  Get the right enemies, and you will have the right friends!<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> You can always know where you enemies are.  Can never be sure about friends.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> It is far better to lose battles with true friends than to win with the enemy.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> You do not lose a battle when you fight with true friends because you will always be fighting again for the same things.  There is no victory when you win with an enemy.  That’s the reason I have never liked politics and politicians.  They are always switching sides – changing bed partners in their politics.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> No other military organization is going to fight as hard and as fast as we will fight.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> Until we know how friendly troops will fight, do not count on them to do much more than bring up our mail!<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> Now and then we could get caught in a trap set by the enemy, but not if we are alert.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> We will always know more about what the enemy is going to do than their own commanders. <BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> Move fast and in a direction the enemy never expects.  The chance of taking losses is too great to fight on a battle site which pleases the enemy.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> We will decide where and when we will kill the enemy.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>When the enemy wavers, throw caution to the winds…  Caution leads to a new battle.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> [Requoted Napoleon] Fortune is a woman who must be wooed while she is in the mood.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> When the decision has to be made, we will never hesitate.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> [On the Battle of the Bulge] I maintained my contention that it is better to attack with a small force at once, and attain surprise, than it is to wait and lose it.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> To hell with taking three days to regroup!<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> We’ll not need food when we are winning!  We will eat the enemy!<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> The thing as I see it is to get a definite, simple plan quickly, and win by execution and careful detailed study of the tactical operation of lesser units.  Execution if the thing, that and leadership.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> There is but one time to do a thing.  That is the first.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> There is no next time.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> Get a determined bunch of men and women and they will win the battles no matter what the odds or what kind of equipment they use.<BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">George S Patton<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="george-s-patton-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="george-s-patton-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="george-s-patton-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="george-s-patton-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="george-s-patton-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="george-s-patton-quotes-6.html">6<a/>   </p><p><BR>
