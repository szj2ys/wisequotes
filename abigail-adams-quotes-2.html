Life, liberty and property, is it possible to have a wish or desire which is not interwoven with the present and future prosperity, freedom and independence of United America?  It depends upon the people to say that they will remain a free and happy Republic.

<BR>
[On the American Revolution] The only alternative which every American thinks of is liberty or death.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>

The friends of liberty, should any such remain will have one option still left, and will rather choose no doubt to die the last British freemen, than bear to live the first of British slaves, and this now seems to be all that is left to Americans.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Battle of Bunker Hill] In the midst of sorrow we have abundant cause of thankfulness that so few of our brethren are numbered with the slain, whilst our enemies were cut down like the grass before the sythe.

<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>

Europe has no charms to attach me to it.
<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>

<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="abigail-adams-quotes.html">Abigail Adams<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
