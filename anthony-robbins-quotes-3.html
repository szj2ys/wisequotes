It is our beliefs – about what we’re capable of, about what’s possible or impossible, about who we are.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>In his minds eye, he repeatedly visualised his triumph so intensely that his certainty gave an unquestioned command to his nervous system, and he achieved physical results to match his mental picture.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>So often people blame events for how their lives have turned out.  Yet what really shapes our lives is the meaning we attach to events.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Beliefs make the difference between a lifetime of misery and one of joyous contribution.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Beliefs separate a Mozart from a Mason, causing some individuals to become heroes while others resign themselves to wondering what could have been.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Generalisations – the beliefs you’ve formed about what leads to pain and pleasure.  While such shortcuts allow us to function, they can also severely limit our lives.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Nothing in life has any meaning except the meaning we give it.  One of the marvels of being human is our ability to fill any event with uplifting or devastating significance.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Revolutionise your life by creating a new meaning for a past experience.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Beliefs have the power to create and the power to destroy.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>A belief is nothing more than a feeling of certainty about what something means.  However, we’re not limited to our past as a source of certainty.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>We can turn any idea into a belief if we just provide enough reference experiences to support it.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>While an unshakable sense of certainty can help you accomplish great things, it also has the potential to blind you to the very information that could change your life forever.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Beliefs drive all of our behaviour.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Sometimes in our moments of greatest fear, pain or emotional intensity, we look for relief in the form of a belief.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Because of the passion they inspire in us, convictions propel us to action.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>True genius is the ability to marshall our most potent resources simply by putting ourselves in a state of absolute certainty.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Our brains cannot tell the difference between something we vividly imagine and something we actually experience.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Great leaders are rarely ‘realistic’ by other people’s standards.  They are, however, accurate and intelligent.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>If you’re going to make a mistake, often it’s better to err on the side of overestimating your capabilities.  One of the differences between pessimists and optimists is that after attempting to learn a new skill, pessimists generally assess their performance accurately, while optimists view their behaviour as more effective than it actually was.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Optimists’ positive perceptions provide them with the emotional support and drive to persist and eventually master the skill.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Achievers see problems as transitory.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>If you keep persisting, you will find a way.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>The ability to keep problems in perspective enables achievers to avoid failing prey to the ‘pervasive problem’ mindset.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>To overcome the false belief that a problem is all-encompassing, you must take control of it immediately.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Optimists see failures as learning experiences.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Avoid this belief of the problem being ‘personal’ at all costs.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>All personal break-throughs begin with a change in beliefs.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>In order to be happy, human beings must feel they are continuing to grow.  And in order to success in today’s business world, organizations must constantly be improving.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>The only true security in life comes from knowing that every single day you are improving yourself in some way.  I don’t worry about maintaining the quality of my life, because every day I work on improving it.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>One of the secrets of legendary NBA coach Pat Riley’s success is his commitment to gradual, consistent improvement.  In 1986 he was faced with a major challenge: his team thought they’d played their best, but the championship had still eluded them the year before.  To inspire them to move to the next level, he convinced them that if each enhanced they performance by a mere one percent in five key areas, it would make all the difference.  The genius of this plan was it’s simplicity: everyone felt certain they could achieve it.  Each player had only to dedicate himself to a five percent increase, but multiplied by twelve players, it produced a sixty percent improvement for the team – their best season ever.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>One of the most effective ways to improve your life is simply to identify and reinforce any beliefs you have that will move you in the direction of your dreams.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>It’s time to get rid of beliefs that no longer serve you!<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>The power of expectation in enhancing performance is well documented.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Questions are the laser of human consciousness.  Use their power to cut through any obstacle or challenge.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>What’s the primary difference between people who are successful and those who aren’t?  Quite simply, successful people are those who have asked better questions and, as a result, gotten better answers.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Thinking is nothing but the process of asking and answering questions.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>If we want to change the quality of our lives, we must change what we habitually ask of ourselves and others.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Kids are the all-time champions of questioning.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>Quality questions create a quality life.  Businesses succeed when their decision makers ask the right questions about product lines or markets or strategic planning.  Relationships flourish when people ask the right questions about where potential conflicts exist and how to support each other rather than tearing each other down.  Communities benefit when leaders ask the right questions about what is most important and how citizens can work together toward shared goals.  For whatever area of your life you want to improve, there are questions you can ask that will provide you with answers.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR>All human progress is preceded by new questions.<BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">Anthony Robbins<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="anthony-robbins-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="anthony-robbins-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="anthony-robbins-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="anthony-robbins-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="anthony-robbins-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="anthony-robbins-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="anthony-robbins-quotes-7.html">7<a/> </p><p><BR>
