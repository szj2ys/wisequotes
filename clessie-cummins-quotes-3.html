Bonus quotes about Clessie Cummins and Cummins

[In 1921] Mr Cummins came to me in my office and told me that the engine he was building was not a good one and that his venture was not a success; in fact that all of the money that had been put into it had been lost and that he had little to show for what he had done.  I felt sorry for him and asked him if there was no salvage to be had from the wreck.  He said there was nothing but an idea.  He tried to explain the idea to me with the result that when he told me it would cost $10,000 to prove the idea, I told him I would furnish the money.
