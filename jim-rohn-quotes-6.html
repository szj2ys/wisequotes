When you spend a day, you have one less day to spend. So make sure you spend each one wisely.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Sometimes you need to stay in touch but be out of reach.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Very few of us are authorities on the truth. About the closest that any of us can get is what we hope is the truth or what we think is the truth. That's why the best approach to truth is probably to say, "It seems to me..."<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>There is nothing wrong with affirmations, provided what you are affirming is the truth. If you are broke, for example, the best thing to affirm is, 'I’m broke!"<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If the truth 'isn't enough, then you must become stronger at presenting it.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Sincerity is not a test of truth. We must not make this mistake: He must be right; he's so sincere. It is possible to be sincerely wrong. We can only judge truth by truth and sincerity by sincerity.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Find someone who is willing to share the truth with you.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Count the cost first. Don't pay too big a price for pursuing minor values.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The major value in life is not what you get. The major value in life is what you become. That is why I wish to pay fair price for every value. If I have to pay for it or earn it, that makes something of me. If I get it for free, that makes nothing of me.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>All values must be won by contest, and after they have been won, they must be defended.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Don't sell out your virtue and your value for something you think you want. Judas got the money, but he threw it all away and hung himself because he was so unhappy with himself.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Values were meant to be costly. If it doesn't cost much, we probably wouldn't appreciate the value.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The two great words of antiquity are behold and beware.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Vocabulary enables us to interpret and to express. If you have a limited vocabulary, you will also have a limited vision and a limited future.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Well chosen words mixed with measured emotions is the basis of affecting people.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It's okay to send flowers, but don't let flowers do all the talking. Flowers have a limited vocabulary. About the best flowers can say is that you remembered.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Words do two major things: They provide food for the mind and create light for understanding and awareness.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>All of us, whether rich or poor, young or old, educated or not so educated, are the sum total of all of those people and events that have touched us since first entering this world.  Every thought we’ve entertained has had its effect upon what we now are.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>What we are and what we have, we have slowly brought upon ourselves.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>What is of great importance is who and what it is that leaves its mark today, and each day thereafter.  What we have been is an established and unchangeable fact.  What we can yet become is an unlimited, boundless opportunity.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>It is essential that each of us find what we were meant to do if true happiness is to be found.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We tend to accumulate and cling to ideas that limit our progress.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Eating alone if better than mingling with those who conversation is negative.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The improvement of our personal circumstances means that we must learn to do what the failures are simply not willing to do.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>A major challenge in life is for each person to learn the art of standing guard at the doorway of their mind.  Carefully examine the credentials and authority of those seeking to enter within that place where your attitudes are formed.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>A sour face does not come as an accident.  It is the result of sour thoughts.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The only limitation placed on our abilities is our inability to easily recognise our unlimited nature.  It takes effort to become aware of our staggering and limitless abilities.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>By our own attitude we and we alone actually decide whether to succeed or fail.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Attitude determines choice, and choice determines results.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Springtime will not admonish you to plant, nor will it warn of the consequences of not planting.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Exercise the discipline to plant in spite of the rocks, weeds or other obstacles before us.  The rocks, weeds, and thorns of the world cannot destroy all your seeds if you plant massively enough and intelligently enough.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The pain of discipline weighs ounces, and the pain of regret tons.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We must either plant during the springtime of life, or beg from others during the fall.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The price, or effort of thinking thoughts of love, prosperity, or self-confidence is no greater than the price given to thoughts of hate, poverty, or self-doubt.  Only the rewards are different.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>To neglect the opportunity given to us this day is to delay our better future.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Progress in any form and happiness or success in any form requires constant effort, for obstacles exist that might discourage the weak and the undeserving.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Life is designed to be a story of achievement in spite of adversity, not in the absence of adversity, for without adversity achievement could not exist.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Smile at adversity, and act quickly to eliminate it.  Expect adversity, for it shall surely appear.  Be grateful for adversity, for it forces the human spirit to grow – for surely, the human character is formed not in the absence of difficulty but in our response to difficulty.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>All things, even adversity, have their worthy purpose.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The harvest which is our life as we now live it, is the result of seeds planted at an earlier time.  Some of the seeds we planted ourselves, through unbreakable habits.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-16.html">16<a/>  </p><p><BR>
