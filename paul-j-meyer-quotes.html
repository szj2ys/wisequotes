At that moment I knew the world’s abundance was mine to earn and to possess … The choice was mine, and everything depended on my attitude.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Necessity is the mother of invention.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>I bought and sold over three hundred bicycles from the time I was thirteen until I was sixteen.  I often wonder if my dad had been able to afford to buy me a bike and had never suggested I build one, whether I would have had such an invaluable experience.  I think not.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>It laid the foundation for my lifelong, invincible attitude of finding a way – or making one.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Experimenting with this magnet brought the law of attraction to life for me.  Positives attract, and negatives repel.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>For the law of attraction to work most powerfully in our lives, we must believe in it.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>I fear taking action.  I am afraid of taking a chance.  In realty, such people fear reaching out for more because they do not believe they can get more.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>People are happy and fulfilled only when they use their lives to fulfil the noble and inspiring purposes for which their creator designed them.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>The positive force and negative force of a magnet cannot coexist in the same mind.  Neither can faith and fear coexist in the same mind.  People full of fear, worry, doubt, indecision, and other negative thinking cannot at the same time possess faith, confidence, belief and positive expectancy.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>If we want plenty, we have to think plenty.  If we want wealth, we have to think wealth.  If we want health, we have to think health.  And if we want happiness, we must think happiness.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>According to the law of attraction, ‘You actually bring favourable circumstances and conditions into being by thinking about and concentrating on the positives in your life.’<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Our bodies are temples or homes where we live.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Today is the first day of the rest of your life.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>When you are through learning, you are through.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Work overcomes adversity and defeat.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>People who do not possess a passion for their work should get out and pursue some other career.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>The principle reason for failure is thinking failure.  People can change their way of life only when they change their way of thinking.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>The ability to make money – accumulate wealth – is a result of becoming successful, not the entirety of success itself.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Motivate people to their full potential.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>I inherited a fortune!  My inheritance came with no restrictions or limitations. [Inheritance from within]<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>As I have grown older, I am even more convinced that these firings [From jobs] were blessings in disguise because they stimulated my entrepreneurial spirit and nurtured a sense of independence.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Principles: I) Be sure as owner or manager to structure all compensations fairly II) Treat people the way you would like to be treated III) Pay people commensurate with their capacity and capability to produce as opposed to a ‘set amount’ for a ‘set job’ IV) Pick the right person for the right job at the right time.  No two of us are alike.  We are all different.  We always have been, and we always will be.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Money is only an idea.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>When people think of themselves as successful they succeed.  When they think of themselves as wealthy, they usually do what it takes to become wealthy.  In contrast, people who feel inferior act inferior.  People who consider themselves failures fail.  People who think of themselves as poor remain poor.  A poor self-image is an imposing, impenetrable barrier to achieving financial success.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Most people respect money.  Anyone who doesn’t spend time working is a disgrace, and money that is not working is even more disgraceful, it doesn’t have any aches and pains to excuse it.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Few wealthy people have a lot of cash because it is invested.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>You take calculated risks.  You think things through, you set goals, and you plan.  But you also take action.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Many people do not want to take a risk until they know that everything is exactly perfect.  They sit back and wait for the perfect moment, the perfect investment, the perfect situation.  The trouble with that approach is that it almost never comes.  Similarly, numerous people analyse and think about it too long – worry about it – they simply choose to avoid all risks.  Successful people take chances.  Successful people take risks.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Concentrate on your strengths rather than your weaknesses.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Focus on past successes and past pleasures.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Negative capability is the ability to bounce back from failure by overcoming obstacles.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Mr Wong said that he had learned everything he know about success from failures.  He did this by analysing why he failed and then by turning the negatives of failure into positives for success.  He wasted no time in worry, doubt or frustration over why he was facing obstacles.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>I have learned over a lifetime some very, very important principles about listening: I) Never talk confidential business in a restaurant or any other public place and II) Keep your ears open in public places and listen for opportunities.  Be alert, pay attention, see and hear what others miss and create your own luck.<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>Seize the day!<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR>No doubt about it – knowledge also increases my confidence!  I know from experience that my knowledge bolsters my confidence.  When I know what I am talking about, I can pursue my goal enthusiastically because self-confidence gives me a clear vision of my goal and creates desire that is strong enough to sweep away almost any obstacles.  <BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes-4.html">4<a/> </p><p><BR>
