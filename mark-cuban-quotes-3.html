I can’t go more than a week without shooting baskets.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I can shoot pretty well.  Playing in a game?  Well, it’s not quite what it used to be.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Playing basketball was just something I had to do no matter how good I was, and it’s something I will always do, no matter how old I get.

<BR>
<BR>
Real competition comes from the sport of business.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In sports, you know who your opponents are.  You know when you are going to play a game.  You know pretty much how long the game will last.  It’s mentally and physically exhausting if you are at the top of the game, but it still pales in comparison to the effort required to be successful in business.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The sport of business isn’t divided into games.  It’s not defined by practices.  It doesn’t have set rules that everyone plays by.  The sport of business is the ultimate competition.  It’s 7 x 24 x 365 x forever.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I love the sport of business.  I love the competition.  I love the fire of it.

<BR>
<BR>
I may be sitting in front of the TV, but I’m not watching it unless I think there is something I can learn from it.  I’m thinking about things I can use in my business and the TV is just there.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I could take the time to read a fiction book, but I don’t.  I would rather read websites, newspapers, magazines, looking for ideas and concepts that I can use.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I spend time in bookstores because one idea from a book or magazine can make me money.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m not going to go to dinner with you just to chat.  I’m not going to give you a call to see how you are.  Unless you want to talk business.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A lot of people say owners should sit in the skybox and chomp on a cigar.  But when you build a company, there are organizational dynamics.  Who are the leaders?  How do people interact with each other?  How do they deal with pressure?  You can’t get that sense from the skybox.  If you’re removed, you don’t know how to make decisions.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A company’s price can have less to do with a company’s real prospects than with the excitement it and its supporters are able to generate.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>

Fundamentals is a word invented by sellers to find buyers.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The stock market has gone from a place where investors actually own part of a company and have a say in their management, to a market designed to enrich insiders by allowing them to sell shares they buy cheaply through options.  Companies continuously issue new shares to their managers without asking their existing shareholders.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Once you get past the raising capital part of the market, the stock market becomes not only inefficient, but as close to a Ponzi scheme as you can get.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Wall Street stockbrokers] I have tried to tell people to be careful before they turned over their life savings and their financial future to someone whose first job is to keep their job, not make you money.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Facebook] FB is what it is.  It’s a time waster… FB doesn’t seem to want to accept that it’s best purpose in life is as a huge time suck…
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>

<BR>
Put your Mickey Mantle rookie card on your desk, and a share of your favorite non-dividend paying stock next to it, and let it sit there for twenty years.  After twenty years you would still have two pieces of paper sitting on your desk.  The difference in value would come from how well they are marketed.

<BR>
It asked its customers what features they wanted to see in the product and then delivered on those features.  It seemed like good business:  Ask your customers what they want, and then give it to them.  Unfortunately for this company, its competitor didn’t ask its customers what they wanted.  Instead, the competitor had a vision of doing things differently.  As a result, they did it better.

Alan Kay once said: ‘The best way to predict the future is to invent it.’
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Consumers aren’t sages.  They aren’t in the business of imaging the next great thing.  That’s the job of innovators, who don’t have a choice.  To borrow a phrase from my friend, Gary Shapiro, they either ‘innovate or die.’
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Those who rely on someone else to tell them what the future holds usually find themselves six feet under before they even realize they’re in the coffin.    But progress – real progress – is like that.  It’s punishing and it’s merciless.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>

Innovation is the key in reversing our [The United States] decline.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>

[In October 2010] It’s time we stop focusing on the success of one party or ideology, and start focusing on the success of our country.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2010] Remember the American Dream… the Dream that I have been fortunate to live.  The Dream our ancestors came to this country to live.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It might not be easy.  And it might not be instant but if you are committed, if you have energy, flexibility and have the right mental attitude, you can overcome any odds.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe if you wish upon a star your dream can come true.  But most people want freedom, success and blessings to be given to them.  It does not work like that.

[In December 2011] I think buy and hold is a crock of sh*t.

[On spending time on investing] I don’t have to spend much time until it hits the fan.

In 2006 and 2007 I was writing blogs saying ‘Look the stock markets for suckers.’  When you sit down at the business table you always look for the sucker, and if you don’t see it – it’s you. 
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My approach has always been, unless I know something specific – put it in cash.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2008/2009] I also piled into Australian bonds because I thought the economy was good next to China, and was my way of playing China…
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can’t diversify enough to know what you’re doing.
