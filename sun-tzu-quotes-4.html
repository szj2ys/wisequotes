Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy.  So much for river warfare.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.  If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees.  So much for operations in salt-marshes.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country.  These are the four useful branches of military know ledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>All armies prefer high ground to low, and sunny places to dark. If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilise the natural advantages of the ground.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with loam, you must wait until it subsides.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses, should be left with all possible speed and not approached.  While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them we should let the enemy have them on his rear.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>If in the neighbourhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry.  When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds ofdust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Clamour by night betokens nervousness.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's minority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst I lie rank and file.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources; too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking demands off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.  If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made.  What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, they will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.  Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline.  This is a certain road to victory.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.  If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: 1) Accessible ground; 2) entangling ground; 3)  temporising ground; 4) narrow passes; 5) precipitous heights; 6) positions at a great distance from the enemy.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-7.html">7<a/> </p><p><BR>
