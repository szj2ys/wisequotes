I paid for the mountains, I paid for the undulations, I paid for the flats.  I was losing time, and I could feel it.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>There had been two journeys really: the journey to get to the tour, and then the journey of the tour itself.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was stunned.  I’d spent years winning bike races, and nobody in the States had cared.  Now everybody cared.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>If you ever get a second chance in life for something, you’ve got to go all the way.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>If you asked me to choose between winning the Tour de France and cancer, I would choose cancer.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I would rather have the title of cancer survivor than winner of the tour, because of what it has done for me as a human being, a man, a husband, a son, and a father.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>There was a more ordinary act of survival still to come: parenthood.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I floored it.  I drove 105 in a 35 zone.  I screeched into the driveway, helped Kik into the car, and then drove more carefully to St. David’s Hospital…<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Forget what they tell you about the miracle of childbirth, and how it’s the greatest thing that ever happens to you.  It was horrible, terrifying, one of the worst nights of my life, because I was so worried for Kik, and for our baby, for all of us.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>I was scared when I was diagnosed with cancer, and I was scared when I was being treated, but it was nothing to what I felt when they took our baby away from us.  <BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I felt totally helpless, because this time it wasn’t me who was sick, it was somebody else.  It was my son.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>He screamed like a world-class, champion screamer.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>The question that lingers is, how much was I a factor in my own survival, and how much was science, and how much miracle?  I don’t have the answer to that question.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I can deliver motivation, inspiration, hope, courage, and counsel, but I can’t answer the unknowable.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>We can take responsibility for ourselves and be brave.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>We each cope differently with the spectre of our deaths.  I think we are supposed to try to face it straightforwardly, armed with nothing but courage.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>The definition of courage is: the quality of spirit that enables one to encounter danger with firmness and without fear.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>It’s a fact that children with cancer have higher cure rates than adults with cancer, and I wonder if the reason is their natural, unthinking bravery.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Sometimes little kids seem better equipped to deal with cancer than grown-ups are.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Adults know too much about failure; they’re more resigned and fearful.  Kids say, ‘I want to play.  Hurry up, and make me better’.  That’s all they want.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>To him it’s not about cancer.  It’s just about the cereal.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>When you think about it, what other choice is there but to hope?  We have two options, medically and emotionally: give up, or fight like hell.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>If children have the ability to ignore odds and percentages, then maybe we can all learn from them.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Anything’s possible.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>You can be told you have a 90 percent chance or a 50 percent chance or a 1 percent chance, but you have to believe, and you have to fight.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>It’s another fact of cancer that the more informed and empowered patient has a better chance of long-term survival.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>The one thing the illness has convinced me of beyond all doubt – more than any experience I’ve had as an athlete – is that we are much better than we know.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>If there is a purpose to the suffering that is cancer, I think it must be this: it’s meant to improve us.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I am very firm in my belief that cancer is not a form of death.  I choose to redefine it: it is a part of life.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>It sounds like the wail of life to me.  The louder he cries, the more I smile.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Pain is temporary.  If I quit, however, it lasts forever.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>You might say pain is my chosen way of exploring the human heart.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>With each race I feel that I further define my capacity for living.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>If there is one thing I don’t want to hear, it’s that I can’t do something.  Telling me that is the best way to make sure that I’ll do it.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>To fully understand a climb, you have to know where you will suffer most so you can brace yourself for that; where you can rest a little; and where you can potentially attack.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was the only fool who was willing to climb it in that weather even once [Four hours of uphill work], much less twice.  But that was the point.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>The one thing you can expect in the tour is the unexpected.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>There is an unwritten rule that you don’t attack when a leader is relieving himself, but somebody attacked anyway, and the peloton got angry and chased him down, as if to scold him.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>It had now rained for nine of the first ten stages, and I didn’t care if it ever stopped.  Once again, I believe that nobody in the world was better at suffering.  <BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-9.html">9<a/> </p><p><BR>
