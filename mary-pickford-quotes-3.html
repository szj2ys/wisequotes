[On Charlie Chaplin rejecting to sell United Artists for $5 million for his share and $7.5 million for Mary Pickfords share – the buyer then refused to buy as they wanted 100% of the shares] I thought I had seen Charlie in a tantrum, but this beat everything.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Charlie Chaplin’s business acumen] Poor Charlie was no businessman at all.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Charlie, I’m not here as your partner today.  I’m not even here as someone that’s been your friend for so many years.  I’m here as the voice of our thousands of employees the world over, of the producers and bankers – [‘If you’re here as the voice of the bankers the interview is terminated.’ – Charlie Chaplin]

<BR>
<BR>
[In 1905 on there being 21,000 actors in the U.S. all with theater as their principal outlet] No one can have an idea of what this means who has not personally looked for work on the stage.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Why not?  I made them.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In the 1930’s] I can’t imagine any worse Hades, than to have to go and look at ten year old films of myself.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In her will] When I go, my films go.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t know where I got this ham blood in me.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I can close my eyes now and hear that scream of mother’s at the moment my father passed on.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When Father died, I realized, with a strange and frightening suddenness, that Mother was alone.  Father had been such a handsome man and Mother adored him.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[As a young child after her father had passed away] Mama, have you next month’s rent, and money for the coal?  [‘No, darling, but don’t worry, we’ll get [it] somehow.’ – Charlotte (Mary’s mother)]
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being told by her mother that if she chose to live with the Smiths, she would not be her mother’s child any longer] I said ‘Mama, don’t you want me any more?’ [‘I’ll always want you, darling, but I can’t give you the pony and cart, and I can’t give you chicken and ice cream every day.’ –Charlotte (Her mother)] I don’t want to be Dr Smith’s little girl and I don’t like ponies and I want to go home with you, Mama!… A determination was born in me the day of our visit to Dr Smith that nothing could crush: I must try to take my father’s place in some mysterious way, and prevent anything from breaking up my family.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her missing her father] If there is any who believe that a child forgets in a day, look at me and learn that the memory of childhood unhappily is longer.  I did not forget him in a day.  I never forgot him, and the plays in which I appeared as a child unfortunately had the lines to remind me of my loss.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[The theater] Was my playhouse.  It was my nursery.  It was my school.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People of the theater, do not rise early…
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Nonsense is not tolerated round the stage.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The show must go on.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On David Belasco]You can’t like a deity; you fear it.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Around the age of 17 in 1909] Miss Pickford is the name – Mary Pickford.  I’m an actress and an artist, and I must have a guarantee of $25 a week and extra when I work extra.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
They’re going to pay me ten dollars a day from tomorrow on.  [‘You see, I was right after all, dear.’ – Charlotte]

<BR>
If you have made mistakes… there is always another chance for you… you may have a fresh start any moment you choose, for this thing we call ‘failure’ is not the falling down, but the staying down.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1923] I have to worry so much about distribution now that my ability as an actress is impaired.  Producers have so bottled up the best theaters that it is often impossible to get a showing of my pictures in them.  I will retire from the business if the conditions become worse… Key cities mean two-fifths of the returns.  If the market is closed by block booking the producers owning theaters will eliminate the people who are seeking to make big pictures and conditions will lapse into the state of three years ago.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Douglas Fairchild] Douglas had always faced a situation the only way he knew how, by running away from it.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I was just a child, I was forced to live far beyond my years; now I have 
reversed the order and I intend to remain young indefinitely.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A spirit stronger than myself has always whipped me to action.  It was as though some outside force lashed me from one step to another.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve worked and fought my way through since I was twelve, and I know business.
