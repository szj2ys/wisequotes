Getting it 80% right in 20% of the time means you can do 5 times the amount of things you want.  You can often achieve 80% of the desired result for 20% of the cost.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>A body will continue in the same direction unless impacted by an outside force.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>A manager who loves to get his photo in the paper, spends time in the clubs with his competitors, delegates all labour responsibility to his IR managers, delegates all sales responsibility to his salesmen and does everything to make himself more attractive to his next boss is not the manager for me.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Philanthropy and generosity are things you learn in the house of your father.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Look ahead 12, 24, and 60 months.  What can you predict?<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Seek mentors.  Ask yourself what they would do in each situation.  Not just what they’d say.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Put your family first and your job second.  But make sure your job really does come second and not third or fourth.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Ask yourself: With this person, can I succeed?  With them, can I make money?<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>There are 200 Visy millionaires.  I am proud we have achieved this, but there should be even more.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>People like to impress their spouse.  Hand-write ‘thank you’ notes and send them to your employees’ homes.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Different things motivate different people and their motivations change depending on their time of life.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Forty years ago, in a factory of 200 people, everybody was either making it or selling it.  Today, only half of the 200 are making and selling.  A sure way to go broke is for administration to continue to grow while the numbers who are making and selling shrink.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>You can’t give your employees too much information.  After all, how would you like playing in or watching a football game with no scoreboard?<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>It’s so easy for people to take easy options.  I despise being bored and having nothing to do, so I fill up my life as much as possible.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>I’ve never seen a statue dedicated to a committee.  You have to have a champion of the cause.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>I just try to squeeze as much as I can into every day.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>[On entering the Amcor building, Richard mounted the elaborate staircase that led to the executive level.  On the stairs he met the Amcor executive: ‘Richard, you’re late, and you’ve got dust all over your shoes!’ said his adversary.  Richard replied:]  Yes, that’s paper dust – you don’t remember it I suppose. <BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>The people who say it can’t be done should get out of the way of the people doing it.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>There’s still bigger fish in the ocean than have ever been caught.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Maybe some things are impossible.

Companies literally attack each other.  I think this is why so many Australian companies have difficulties here – they expect you can act like you do at home, and it is just not enough.<BR><a href="anthony-pratt-quotes.html">Anthony Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Ali’s [Muhammad Ali] a marvellous character.  We love him, our customers love him and when he comes into our factories you’ve never seen anything like it.  Loads of staff told me meeting him was the biggest day of their lives.<BR><a href="anthony-pratt-quotes.html">Anthony Pratt<a/><BR><BR>It’s not really an extravagance at all.  We deal directly with our customers, the box makers, and it’s vital for us to get them to visit our sites.  Who can resist doing that when they know that Muhammad Ali might be there?  We need a point of difference to compete with the much bigger American companies, and this is it.  What other company gives a box maker and his wife a chance to have their picture taken with Tony Curtis?<BR><a href="anthony-pratt-quotes.html">Anthony Pratt<a/><BR><BR>My dad has always taught me the importance of relationships.  When I was a kid, I used to go around with him in the car when he was a salesman for the business.  These guys would regularly tell me how important he was to them and what a special relationship they had with him.  It’s a lesson I’ll never forget.<BR><a href="anthony-pratt-quotes.html">Anthony Pratt<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="richard-pratt-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="richard-pratt-quotes-3.html">3<a/> </p><p><BR>
