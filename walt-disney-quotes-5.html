There is more treasure in books than in all the pirates’ loot on Treasure Island and at the bottom of the Spanish Main… and best of all, you can enjoy these reaches every day of your life.

<BR>
<BR>
We allow no geniuses around our Studio.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Around here… we don’t look backwards for very long.  We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we’re curious… and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Until a character becomes a personality it cannot be believed.  Without personality, the character may do funny or interesting things, but unless people are able to identify themselves with the character its actions will seem unreal.  And without personality, a story cannot ring true to the audience.

<BR>
<BR>
What are you doing with a car here in 1860?

<BR>
<BR>
When we do fantasy, we must not lose sight of reality.

I don’t believe there’s a challenge anywhere in the world that’s more important to people everywhere than finding solutions to the problems of our cities.  But where do we begin – how do we start answering this great challenge?  Well, we’re convinced we must start answering the public need.  And the need is not just for curing the ills of old cities.  We think the need is for starting from scratch on virgin land and building a special kind of community that will always be in a state of becoming.  It will never cease to be a living blueprint of the future, were people actually live a life they can’t find anywhere else in the world.

<BR>
All right.  I’m corny.  But I think there’s just about a hundred and forty million people in this country that are just as corny as I am.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I do not like to repeat successes, I like to go on to other things.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>

Mickey mouse is, to me, a symbol of independence.  He was a means to an end.  He popped out of my mind onto a drawing on a train ride from Manhattan to Hollywood at a time when business fortunes of my brother Roy and myself were at their lowest ebb and disaster seemed right around the corner.  Born of necessity, the little fellow literally freed us of immediate worry.  He provided the means for expanding our organization to its present dimensions and for extending the medium of cartoon animation toward new entertainment levels.  He spelled production liberation for us.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All we ever intended for him or expected of him was that he should continued to make people everywhere chuckle with him and at him.  We didn’t burden him with any social symbolism, we made him no mouthpiece for frustrations or harsh satire.  Mickey was simply a little personality assigned to the purposes of laughter.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I do not make films primarily for children.  I make them for the child in all of us, whether we be six or sixty.  Call the child ‘innocence’.  The worst of us is not without innocence, although buried deeply it might be.  In my work I try to reach and speak to that innocence, showing it the fun and joy of living; showing it that laughter is healthy; showing it that the human species, although happily ridiculous at times, is still reaching for the stars.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Somehow, I can’t believe that there are any heights that can’t be scaled by a man who knows the secret of making dreams come true.  The special secret it seems to me is summarized in four C’s.  They are Curiosity, Courage, Confidence and Constancy.  And the great of all is Confidence.  When you believe in a thing, believe in it all the way, implicitly and unquestionably.  
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Faith I have, in myself, in humanity, in the worthwhileness of the pursuits in entertainment for the masses.  But wide awake, not blind faith, moves me.  My operations are based on experience, thoughtful observation and warm fellowship with my neighbors at home and around the world.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am interested in entertaining people, in bringing pleasure, particularly laughter, to others, rather than being concerned with ‘expressing’ myself with obscure creative impressions.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I started on Disneyland, my wife used to say ‘But why do you want to build an amusement part?  They’re so dirty.’  I told her that was just the point – mine wouldn’t be.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Disneyland is something that will never be finished.  It’s something that I can keep developing.  It will be a live, breathing thing that will need change.  A picture is a thing, once you wrap it up and turn it over to Technicolor, you’re through.  Snow White is a dead issue with me.  But I can change the park, because it’s alive.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Fantasy, if it’s really convincing, can’t become dated, for the simple reason that it represents a flight into a dimension that lies beyond the reach of time.  In this new dimension, whatever it is, nothing corrodes or gets run down at the heal or gets to look ridiculous like, say, the celluloid collar or the bustle.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Every child is born blessed with a vivid imagination.  But just as a muscle grows flabby with disuse, so the bright imagination of a child pales in later years if he ceases to exercise it.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s a mistake not to give people a chance to learn to depend on themselves while they are young.

<BR>
In my view, wholesome pleasure, sport, and recreation are as vital to this nation as productive work and should have a large share in the national budget.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
That’s the real trouble with the world, too many people grow up.  They forget.  They don’t remember what it’s like to be twelve years old.  They patronize; they treat children as inferiors.  I won’t do that.  I’ll temper a story, yes.  But I won’t play down, and I won’t patronize.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To the youngsters of today, I say believe in the future, the world is getting better; there still is plenty of opportunity.  Why, would you believe it, when I was a kid I thought it was already too late for me to make good at anything.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I always like to look on the optimistic side of life, but I am realistic enough to know that life is a complex matter.  With the laugh comes the tears and in developing motion pictures or television shows, you must combine all the facts of life – drama, pathos and humor.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Leadership implies a strong faith or belief in something.  It may be a cause, an institution, a political or business operation in which a man takes active direction by virtue of his faith and self-assurance.  And, of course leadership means a group, large or small, which is willing to entrust such authority to a man – or a woman – in judgment, wisdom, personal appeal and proven competence.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Do a good job.  You don’t have to worry about the money; it will take care of itself.  Just do your best work – then try to trump it.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Art was always a means to an end with me.  You get an idea, and you just can’t wait.  Once you’ve started, then you’re in there with the punches flying.  There’s plenty of trouble, but you can handle it.  You can’t handle it.  You can’t back out.  It gets you down once in a while, but it’s exciting.  Our whole business is exciting.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe firmly in the efficacy of religion, in its powerful influence on a person’s whole life.  It helps immeasurably to meet the storms and stress of life and keep you attuned to the Divine inspiration.  Without inspiration, we would perish.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Every person has his own ideas of the act of praying for God’s guidance, tolerance, and mercy to fulfill his duties and responsibilities.  My own concept of prayer is not as a plea for special favors nor as a quick palliation for wrongs knowingly committed.  A prayer, it seems to me, implies a promise as well as a request; at the highest level, prayer not only is a supplication for strength and guidance, but also becomes an affirmation of life and thus a reverent praise of God.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Deeds rather than words express my concept of the part religion should play in everyday life.  I have watched constantly that in our movie work the highest moral and spiritual standards are upheld, whether it deals with fable or with stories of living action.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t believe in playing down to children, either in life or in motion pictures.  I didn’t treat my own youngsters like fragile flowers, and I think no parent should.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Children are people, and they should have to reach to learn about things, to understand things, just as adults have to reach if they want to grow in mental stature.  Life is composed of lights and shadow, and we would be untruthful, insincere, and saccharine if we tried to pretend there were no shadows.  Most things are good, and they are the strongest things; but there are evil things too, and you are not doing a child a favor by trying to shield him from reality.  The important thing is to teach a child that good can always triumph over evil, and that is what our pictures attempt to do.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The American child is a highly intelligent human being – characteristically sensitive, humorous, open-minded, eager to learn, and has a strong sense of excitement, energy, and healthy curiosity about the world in which he lives.  Lucky indeed is the grown-up who manages to carry these same characteristics into adult life.  It usually makes for a happy and successful individual.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have long felt that the way to keep children out of trouble is to keep them interested in things.  Lecturing to children is no answer to delinquency.  Preaching won’t keep youngsters out of trouble, but keeping their minds occupied will.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To me, today, at age sixty-one, all prayer, by the humble or highly placed has one thing in common: supplication for strength and inspiration to carry on the best human impulses which should bind us together for a better world.  Without such inspiration, we would rapidly deteriorate and finally perish.  But in our troubled time, the right of men to think and worship as their conscience dictates is being sorely pressed.  We can retain these privileges only by being constantly on guard and fighting off any encroachment on these precepts.  To retreat from any of the principles handed down by our forefathers, who shed their blood for the ideas we still embrace, would be a complete victory for those who would destroy liberty and justice for the individual.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>

Here in Florida… we have something special we never enjoyed at Disneyland – the blessing of size.  There’s enough land here to hold all the ideas and plans we can possibly imagine.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The most exciting and by far the most important part of our Florida Project – in fact, the heart of everything we’ll be doing in Disney World – will be our Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow!  We call it EPCOT.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
EPCOT will be an experimental prototype community of tomorrow that will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of American industry.  It will be a community of tomorrow that will never be completed, but will always be introducing and testing and demonstrating new materials and systems.  And EPCOT will always be a showcase to the world for the ingenuity and imagination of American free enterprise.

[To Ollie Johnston on his miniature railroad] I didn’t know you were interested in trains, too.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Yes, in one way or another I have always loved trains.
