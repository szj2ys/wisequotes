<BR>
Our cars are meant to be driven.  Not polished.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to build cars that were not something to everyone but meant everything to some.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is better to enter a turn slow and come out fast, than to enter a turn fast and come out dead.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997] The latest car is always the most beautiful.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To have earned the affection of boys is to possess a great emotional treasure.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I come from a time when no one wanted to view cars anymore as purely a uniform.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had an idea at the right time and took the risk of putting this idea into practice.  The idea was to make a sports car featuring outstanding performance, and the risk consisted of investing all available means into producing it.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There are countless books with formulas on how to achieve success, and they contain all manner of good ideas.  I’ve never read any of them.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Progress has to be reasonable.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can’t force things in life.  There is little that I detest more than force.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Cars offered enormous freedom.  And that freedom, I think, has changed people.  
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There has never been a quiescent point in the evolution of the automobile.  We face many problems today, and once we’ve solved those, we’ll face many new ones.  We will keep on striving for perfection.  Motorsports has always been able to make important contributions to solving these problems, and will continue to do so in the future.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is no such thing as the perfect car.  But as engineers and designers, we have to do everything in our power to approach this ideal.  
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We simply built the car that we felt was right.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you manage to create something that withstands time, something that remains untouched by the eccentricities of a particular age – something timeless, in other words – that is the greatest achievement.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You may always modify a Porsche, but its character and inimitable quality must be maintained.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It all comes down to never giving up, and to responding to crises with the right answers.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We all harbor a wish to be immortal.  That’s why we try to leave something behind which shows that we were here and that we accomplished something of meaning.  The search for a purpose in our lives is universal, and will never change.  Finding an aim in life is the essence of the human spirit.  That is why functional designs are so marvellous… and so reassuring.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the air-cooled engine.] The problem is not getting cool air to the engine, it’s getting the hot air away.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Committees are by nature – timid.  Based on the premise of safety in numbers, content to survive rather than take risks and move independently ahead.  
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
In the beginning I looked around and could not find quite the car I dreamed of – a small, light weight sportscar which used power efficiently.  So I decided to build it myself.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is said I believe that so many creations today are just like all the rest.  This is why Porsche must remain small and independent.  
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Without independence, without the freedom to try new ideas, we will invariably not move ahead but instead live in fear of it’s own potential.  
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Time is one of the few things man cannot influence.  It gives each of us a beginning and an end.  This makes us question what comes in between.  
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The one thing that is universal is the search for purpose.  It is the essence of the human spirit to seek a reason for being.  That is why functional designs are so beautiful, so calming.  
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course timeless design is wasted if it cannot survive.  That is why we test and race our cars so hard.  Creating something that time cannot erode, something which ignores time as a physically ending concept – this is the ultimate victory.      
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On USAC ‘simplifying’ or ‘changing’ the rules before a race.] How can you change the rules with one month to the race?  We cannot test and develop a new engine in one month?  We cancel the project!
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
No, Herr Schutz.  You don’t understand our problem.  We have people who know how to design automobiles, how to build them, to sell them and service them.  Our problem is that we’re not making any money.  
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When we explore the reasons for our poor earnings, we see that people in our organization are simply not working together… We are looking for someone who can get this whole organization unified and working together.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The exhaust gas turbocharger is capable not only of achieving considerable increases in performance, but also of improving the efficiency of the engine and thus saving fuel.  The technology involved was nothing new to us when we came to use it in competition cars, since we had already used it during the war in our air-cooled diesel engines for tanks.  Having been subjected to rigorous tests in our competition cars, the turbocharger then found its way into our production cars.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the original Porsche design brief.] Driving in its purest form.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being asked by his young son Butzi (Ferdinard Alexander Porsche) Porsche why he wasn’t in the army like all the other fathers.]  Just imagine.  If we were all soldiers, who would design and build the tanks and all the other weapons?
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The kind of cooperation one might have hoped for between my children and those of my sister (Louise Piech, Ferdinand Piech’s mother) did not materialize.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1940] In the prevailing slippery ground conditions in the mountains… our four-wheel drive Types 86 and 87 cars without snow chains were vastly superior to the Army Uniform Personnel Car.  For example, our Type 87 climbed the approximately 25-degree slope of the Hungerberg without trouble, while the wheels of the Uniform car began to skid after a stretch of about 30 meters.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It has our name on it, so we are concerned to be sure it is going to be right.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had to realize that a body designer was not necessarily a styling man, and vice versa.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On what is the secret behind the fame of the Porsche make.]  One would have to delve back into the past.  As a young boy, I was surprised that my father was known worldwide, more so than any other automobile designer.  He always made the news when he transferred from Austro-Daimler to Daimler and later to Steyr.  
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I myself have never attempted to actively build my own profile but rather continued in my father’s image.  The end of my father’s impressive epoch and the start in Stuttgart under my management are tightly interwoven.  The Porsche mystique developed during my father’s time but did not reach it’s climax…
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The fact that my father himself never built a Porsche car is also of historical interest.  He only worked for other firms.  My father was not interested in secretive political machinations concerning the development and production of the Volkswagen.  He was only interested in the challenge the task presented.  We produced our first cars after the war and it was logical that the name Porsche lived on…
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I took a different approach and improved its performance by radically reducing its weight rather than increasing engine power.
