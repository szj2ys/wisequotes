All this changed when I became a fund manager.  I was putting my money where my mouth was and I could not afford to dissociate myself from my investment decisions.  I had to use all my intellectual resources and I discovered, to my great surprise and gratification, that my abstract ideas came in very handy.  It would be an exaggeration to say that they accounted for my success; but there can be no doubt that they game me an edge.<BR><a href="george-soros-quotes.html">George Soros<a/><BR><BR>It’s the adventure of ideas that attracts me.  I was also inspired by the fact that I was able to combine the two great abiding interests in my life: philosophical speculation and speculation in financial markets.  Both seemed to benefit from the combination: together, they engaged me more than either one on its own.<BR><a href="george-soros-quotes.html">George Soros<a/><BR><BR>The main difference between me and other people who have amassed this kind of money is that I am primarily interested in ideas, and I don’t have much personal use for money.  But I hate to think what would have happened if I hadn’t made money: My ideas would not have gotten much play.<BR><a href="george-soros-quotes.html">George Soros<a/><BR><BR>I wish that I could write a book that will be read for as long as our civilization lasts.  I would value it much more highly than any business success if I could contribute to an understanding of the world in which we live or, better yet, if I could help to preserve the economic and political system that has allow me to flourish as a participant.<BR><a href="george-soros-quotes.html">George Soros<a/><BR><BR>There came a point when they introduced a certificate for security analysts, a sort of professional qualification.  After avoiding it for a while I sat for the exam and I failed in every conceivable topic.  At that point I told my assistant that he had to take it and pass it.  As I understood it, the importance of the certificate would not start to matter for another six or seven years and by that time I would either be so far ahead that I wouldn’t need it, or I would be a failure, in which case, I also wouldn’t need it.<BR><a href="george-soros-quotes.html">George Soros<a/><BR><BR>Nowhere is the role of expectations more clearly visible than in financial markets.  Buy and sell decisions are based on expectations about future prices, and future prices, in turn are contingent on present buy and sell decisions.  To speak of supply and demand as if they were determined by forces that are independent of the market participants’ expectations is quite misleading.  The situation is not quite so clear-cut in the case of commodities, where supply is largely dependent on production and demand on consumption.  But the price that determines the amounts produced and consumed is not necessarily the present price.  On the contrary, market participants are more likely to be guided by future prices, either as expressed in futures markets or as anticipated by themselves.  In either case, it is inappropriate to speak of independently given supply and demand curves because both curves incorporate the participants’ expectations about future prices.<BR><a href="george-soros-quotes.html">George Soros<a/><BR><BR>Being rich, enabled me to do something I really cared about.<BR><a href="george-soros-quotes.html">George Soros<a/><BR><BR>I’m fascinated by chaos.  That’s really how I make my money: understanding the revolutionary process in financial markets.<BR><a href="george-soros-quotes.html">George Soros<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="george-soros-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="george-soros-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="george-soros-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="george-soros-quotes-4.html">4<a/> </p><p><BR>
