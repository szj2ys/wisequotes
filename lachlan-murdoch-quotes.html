<BR>
Good journalism is good business practice; good business supports great journalism.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There are people who in their makeup need to take risks.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Events can happen that are unexpected and out of your control.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think you can’t be afraid to innovate.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Good speeches are those that come from the heart, that ring true.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Expansion drives diversity and diversity protects and strengthens our craft.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Everyday when you put a newspaper together you make a thousand different choices.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You are not only informing them in a newspaper but also entertaining them at the same time.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the image of Fox in 2003] It boils down to being innovators and I think the public knows that when they turn on Fox they can expect the unexpected.  They can expect to be surprised, they can expect for us to push the boundaries and take some risks.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father Rupert Murdoch] He’s had so much experience and he’s got so much energy.  His mind is always working.  I’ve never seen him turn off.  I’ve never seen him put away work for even 24 hours and not think about work.  Even if he’s on a boat.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] I think that one of the lessons in media over the last couple of years is you don’t have to be bigger just for the sake of being bigger.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father Rupert Murdoch’s success] The willingness to go against the common belief.  The willingness to break the mould and go against what people perceive as the world order.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I grew up in New York.  I’m Australian but grew up in New York with a funny ascent.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On doing his Princeton philosophy major thesis on Kant and Hegel] I did then, and I don’t now, understand a word of what I wrote.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To James Packer on him saying about One.Tel ‘Now we’re going to show all those doubters that they were wrong.  And we’re going to be right on this and we’re going to be vindicated.’]   I hope you’re right.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On ending the Super League war] What we have done today, is ensure the survival and prosperity of rugby league.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the family having a country house in New York three hours north of the city] It was really out of the way.  We both had little motorcycles, and used to go through the trails in the woods.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The markets reaction to PCCW really woke us up and made us say ‘wait a minute.’  Here’s a company that’s doing some small broadband and Internet deals with this huge valuation on it.  We’re the number one entertainment/media brand across Asia.  We were getting no value for it… if you apply the same metrics and valuation to Star that was being applied to PCCW, Star would be the most valuable asset in News Corp.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On one of the Sydney to Hobart boat race’s] One of the lessons it does teach is that you never come back here unless you’re totally prepared and you’ve got a professional crew.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I want to challenge what I regard as the orthodoxy of the media elite.  The industry is littered with self-styled purists who believe the business of media – the requirement to make a profit – somehow corrupts the craft.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>

<BR>
<BR>
[There was] No room for dictating tastes in the diverse and dynamic world of the media.  To limit taste only limits the role we play for people of all kinds.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Every once in a while I just have to do things that require me to make judgements about how far I can go.  It’s not that it’s dangerous as much as it’s unprotected, if you know what I mean.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s so big, it’s not really a sailboat anymore.  
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On sailing] For someone who has a job that keeps their mind kind of ticking over all the time, it’s a great way to force yourself to think about something other than work.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Lincoln Hall] I would not have been shocked to hear of his death on the world’s highest mountain.  I would probably have been more shocked to read that he had died in a car accident, or crossing the road.  That’s not because I thought he was some thrill-seeker, some adrenaline junkie with a death wish.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The fact is several great climbers I had either met as a youth or bumped into at climbing campgrounds or parking lots have since prematurely met their end.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The headlines that morning on May 2006 were so shocking not because Lincoln [Hall] died on Everest that night, but because he did not.  
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Lincoln [Hall] wrote in his book White Limbo that ‘The summit was not everything.  Survival was.’…
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Next time you look at a summit picture, try to look beyond the tired faces allowing quick, compulsory smiles framed by panoramic views.  Often you will see something else.  
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] I see the New York Post as one of the great newspapers in America.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We are in a great struggle, the last great newspaper war in this country.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the New York Post] We have to make it a great business as well.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can’t be afraid to be creative from an editorial point of view…
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
First step is to get the readers to notice the newspaper and to pick it up… and then to get the advertisers to follow and prove you’re a great advertising medium as well.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] If you look at all newspapers as an industry we’re all either shrinking by 1 or 2 percent a year…
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Certainly if you look at growing population as part of your market share of eyeballs – television, radio… newspapers are shrinking as an industry.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In a shrinking environment] Having the New York Post grow is fantastic.
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the New York Post] It was frozen in time as a 1970s tabloid.  
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The ink would smudge off on your hands…
<BR><a href="lachlan-murdoch-quotes.html">Lachlan Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the New York Post] People thought it had such a great market position as being a conservative New York newspaper, people didn’t want to change it.
