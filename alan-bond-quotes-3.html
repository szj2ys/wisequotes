<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On calling the Kalgoorlie Super Pit] We’ll mine it for 100 years, and when we’ve finished Kalgoorlie could be the greatest resort town in Western Australia because the pit will become a massive lake where you can sail yachts.  That’s how big this will be when we’re finished.  It will be fantastic.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>

Generally everyone’s lifestyle is proportionate to their wealth, and believe me happiness does not necessarily come in the same proportion.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>

[On Bond Media] It was the ugly and rapid rise in interest rates that was beginning to cripple this media arm because of the debt load, including the lack of the $200 million that we were due to pay Kerry Packer as final settlement on the Nine Network deal.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>

[On owning and paying $52 million in 1987 for Van Gogh’s ‘Irises’.] I could feel Van Gogh’s brush strokes, beautiful brush strokes that captured a freedom of expression, even though the subject was flowers.  The strength of the colours was magnificent, and the thickness of his paint on the canvas was quite astounding – he seemed to trowel it on, and that’s what created the aura that the painting holds for me.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve always believed that you should put back into the community what you get out of it…
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>

The bank just looked after their own position, and not me, a client who had dealt with them in huge amounts for 20 years.  I relied on the bank’s assurances and was badly burnt.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

[On a government inquiry] It was just like someone coming over your back fence to have a look around because they felt like it, and then making assumptions about what they think they saw, and what the neighbours told them.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>

Once things do start exploding all around you your brain explodes with them.  It doesn’t stop – you just keep tossing things over and over in your mind.  I continually asked myself: ‘What could I have done.  Why did I let it happen?’  The anguish of failure is not a pleasant experience.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am a fatalist.  Events don’t ‘just happen’ – they happen for a reason.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think the level of devastation is proportionate to the walk of life you come from.  I’d been dragged down from the top to the lowest possible level by the system itself.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was again paying a price for profile.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Never before had the old adage ‘bad news sells newspapers, good news doesn’t’ been so true.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The tall poppy syndrome was alive and well.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>

It was as if my world ended there and then – three years in jail for what had been a perfectly legal transaction over a painting.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At least no one could take away the fact that in 1978 I was named Australian of the Year.
<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>

<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>

<BR><a href="alan-bond-quotes.html">Alan Bond<a/>
