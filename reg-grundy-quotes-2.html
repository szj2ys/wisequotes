<BR> 
[In August 2005.] We came upon a herd of impala. I sighted my rifle, pulled the trigger and felled one. I felt like I could have disappeared into the earth.  I thought, how could I possibly have killed this beautiful thing?  Right then I said, I'm never going to do this to an animal again, but I will photograph them.  
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2005.] I took happy snaps, that was all.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2005.] Years ago, Joy did a story in this apartment for The Australian Women's Weekly.  And Douglas Kirkland, a photographer who has taken pictures of everyone from Brigitte Bardot to John Lennon, took the photos. He asked to see my stuff and I went to his studio and spilled my transparencies all over his desk. I was so nervous. But he said, ‘That's good stuff.’ He became my mentor and he encouraged me to do this book. So I owe The Weekly thanks. Without it, none of this would have been set in motion.  
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2005 on what he loves about photographing wildlife.] I am absolutely wildly attracted to animals. I love the challenge of capturing an animal in motion, so you can see its power and beauty. Plus, there is so much drama in nature.  
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On photographing a snake he thought was harmless.] I thought it was a pretty snake, so I got down really close.  I found out later its venom rating is 10 and if I had been bitten, it would have been goodnight, Reg.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On photographing Polar Bears.] They are so massive and powerful, but difficult to photograph because it's white on white - and it's so cold.  Some of the animals I photograph might not exist in the future. Let's honour them now while there's time.  
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2005 on being married to his wife Joy for 30 years.] We can't imagine life without one another.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being in his early 40’s then divorced when Joy was a teenager.] I was in Brisbane looking for panellists for the show I've Got a Secret.  I had interviewed 300 girls, when suddenly this voice pipes up and says, You haven't seen me!' I said to my colleague, 'Get rid of her, she's two hours late!' (Joy had got lost.] He said, 'Oh, it will only take five minutes.' Well, Joy got the job - and the man!  
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On even though now based in Bermuda describing themselves as citizens of the world.] I think it gives us a more balanced view on life, seeing how other people live and what is important to them.  But we are always very connected to Australia. We visit often.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2005 on describing his $100 million boat. (Later sold after a few years.)] Boadicea is our floating home that travels the world. A palace on the water.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In 2005 on a memoir he is writing.] It's not an exposé. There will be no gossip about actors, that's not me. I want to tell the story of how I built my business.  If you ask me if I miss the TV business, I'd be a liar to say I didn't, but I got out when I was ready - although I do think about shows from time to time.  I actually have a drawer full of concepts. We'll see.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his wildlife photographs.] Selfishly, I'd like people to understand that I've found another way to entertain my 'audience'. I suppose I'm endeavouring, with this book, to create something that people can own and enjoy. Here's something I can leave behind that people can actually hold, when I go to the great game show in the sky.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2005.] Sometimes when I'm on a shoot I'll just shout: I love this!
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2005.] I started in radio, moved into pictures and sound and now it's just pictures again
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2005 on wildlife photography.  It takes.] Patience and persistence.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2008 on receiving a Companion in the Order of Australia (AC) for service to the entertainment and television industry at the age of 84.] My friends know that I'm never lost for a one-liner, but receiving this honour has left me speechless.  In my mind I'm sharing this Order with the people of Australia who have supported me by watching my shows over the past five decades. 
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2008.] I count myself indeed fortunate to have spent my life doing what I love.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2008 on receiving a Companion in the Order of Australia (AC) after having received an OBE in 1983.] I am a private man and rarely share my feelings with the media, but today is an exception.  To have my nation recognise me in this fashion, is an honour I did not expect to receive.  After a long life with many turnings and surprises, this defining moment is deeply moving for me and Joy, my wife.  
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2008 on being proud of fellow Australians in the television industry.] Over the years I have taken Australian actors, performers, producers, directors, writers and technicians out into the world to make television shows in foreign countries, proving that Australians could lead the world in all areas of television entertainment   
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On a standing ovation in 2010 whilst receiving a special AFI award.] You really don’t know much about me.  I’ve been sort of a secret messenger for about 40 years.  But I must tell you, don’t do that again because it makes me cry.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In 2010.] I was no one man band.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010 on others that helped him along the way to work on all the Grundy shows.] If this award had of been a cake I think I would have cut it up and send a piece to all of them.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010.] You’re in the business of entertaining people.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010 on asking the audience if it was okay if he reads from the tele-prompter.] Is that okay?  Don’t tell anyone will you?
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010.] Keep throwing punches, you’re bound to hit something.  And you know I think it’s right.  If you keep throwing punches you are bound to hit something and you will succeed.  So failure is just a passing fancy.  Because the time comes when it’s your turn.  And that’s what will happen to each and every one of you…
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010.] I’ve been very lucky, enough to hit a few targets that have brought me to this extraordinary evening.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2010 at the age of 87 on reality tv.] So many other people on television are marvellous, but reality shows that are not reality.  If they are very good, like Survivor is a marvellous example, but there are so many that are very poor.  They are supposed to be in the wild all on their own and possibly the producer/director is whispering little things in their ears, what they might say, so the one thing they are not is reality.     
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Somehow or other, I’m eighty-five years old.  I’m told I don’t look it, and I certainly don’t feel it.  I look in my passport to make sure.  Yep, eighty-five.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We were in Bermuda, working our usual seven-day week and living in our beautiful house.  It faced onto a quiet harbour that wrapped around an inlet, giving us our own saltwater lagoon.  Perfect.  What a great place to spend most of our waking hours staring into a computer screen.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Joy and I have the perfect marriage.  She’s my pride and joy, a very talented writer and a smart businesswoman with strongly held views on important matters and a tendency to speak to her rather older husband as if she were his mother.  And me?  Well, I tend to agree with everything she says.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On describing what his autobiography is all about at the age of 85.] A young man who once earned a pound a week at David Jones, who not only realised most of his dreams but hopefully helped others dream some of theirs as well.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
How did I become someone known not just for my undies – my ‘Reg Grundies’ – but for the entertainment I created both in Australia and throughout the world?
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father finding work in Sydney during 1919 four years before he was born.]  Work was hard to find so he stood in line for a job as a ‘useful’.  The man behind him in the queue told of the wife and kids he was trying to support.  Dad said, ‘Your need is greater than mine, mate.  Here – stand in front of me.’  The stranger got the job, but Roy was called in to meet the great man, Ernest Hillier, resplendent in a handmade suit with striking pink shirt and matching tie.  ‘Roy, I was only looking for one man, but you did the right thing for that fella so I’m taking you on as well.’  [Roy Grundy moved quickly through the ranks until he became manager of the store, then overall manager of all twenty Hillier chocolate shops in Sydney.  Reg’s mother was a cashier for Ernest Hillier at the age of 20.]
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1923, I was born.  I was to be their one and only child, the son they loved and adored.  But soon the Depression was hitting hard and Hillier was forced to close his stores.  In 1929, the small Grundy family moved to Adelaide, where Roy had been offered the job of running the food areas of Myers, one of Adelaide’s biggest department stores.  And so it was in Adelaide that my formal education began.  And ended.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was a quiet boy who liked his own company.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[As a boy at primary school.] I vied with my friend Alan Cox to be top of the class.  I never succeeded, always finishing second.  One day, a teacher sent me on an errand to a neighbouring suburb and before returning I stopped by a pond in a small public garden and imagined what it must be like to have whole days when only I would decide what I might do.  A tingle ran through me.  What wonderful things I could achieve.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
‘You’ve got a marvellous voice.  You should be in radio,’ was a common opinion.  It sounded like a great idea to me.  I decided that when I was out of the army I would give myself one year to try and make it happen.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 1946.] Ian Samuels, the program manager, shook my hand.  ‘Okay, Reg.  What experience have you had in radio?’  ‘None,’ I said.  ‘How do I get experience if no one will give me a chance?’  He laughed and handed me two sheets of paper.  ‘Here’s a list of country towns.  Just read the list out loud, then follow up with the news item on the other page.’
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What they needed was someone to describe sporting events.  Could I do that?  I had had no idea, but I thought I might as well give it a shot.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On commentating a wrestling match.] ‘All you’ve got to do is climb that ladder into that crow’s-nest over the number two corner, and then it’s up to you.  Don’t suffer from vertigo, do you?’  I knew I did, but it was too late to turn back.  ‘I’ll be okay, Mr Miller.’  ‘And call me Harry.  Everybody does.’  I don’t know which was more frightening – the climb to the crow’s-nest or the requirement to call what was happening in the ring below.
