<BR>
Luxury is knowing how to live in harmony with oneself and with others.  
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The first step toward serenity and simplicity is to overcome the superfluous.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On forming Giorgio Armani with Sergio Galeotti] We were talented and had ideas.  The rest just happened.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have chosen to make my work my life.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I could enjoy my wealth; I could rent a plane and go off for a week.  But at the end of the day, I would be alone doing that…
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have always liked to fight; I have always fought against the system in a certain sense.  
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have always been a loner.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The press like to be shocked; they like to find something which gives them a shock every season.  They like revolution, big explosions, not evolution.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe that the hand of a human being is very different from the key on a computer.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am very loyal to my roots which is from pure design – a pencil and a sketchbook.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All of my more important clients secretly think they are fashion designers.  
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I like living with luxury, but I am not greedy for it.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am training my brain to leave earthly things.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am learning to value even the simplest things in life…
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Fashion is finished… Fashion is what a woman makes…
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Style is what I’m all about.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am not a creative genius and I am not a marketing genius.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I could have become much richer much quicker if I had decided to take advantage of my name by licensing…
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Work is my life.  I have no time for people.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The goal I seek is to have people refine their style through my clothing without having them become victims of fashion.

<BR>
It’s all crazy now, we’re going too far the other way.  When you see a model now they’re all perfect, they’re all tanned, they all have the same size breasts.  They’ve all had surgery.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Prada and Gucci in 1996] Maybe I went back to the thirties in my work, and they are turning back to the fifties.  The small difference is that in the thirties, the men were elegant; in the fifties, they weren’t at all.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[More on rivals in 1996] I hope they will copy Armani from the eighties next, since we are in the seventies now.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Nobody can tell me what to do – they are frightened to do it, because they think I am so sure of myself, so confident, and I have always got the right answer at the right time.  But I am just as full of insecurities as everyone else.  My work has always demanded that I be very secure, that I have no doubts, that I make these decisions.  In fact, [Martin] Scorsese said to me, ‘When you arrive at the point of being the director, or the manager, everyone comes to you for comfort.  But in fact, what you need is comfort from everyone else.’
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had to decide that I am going to enjoy my work.  Every morning when I wake up and jump out of bed like I did 30 years ago, I think: God, why don’t I just stay in bed and relax, have a leisurely breakfast?  I could enjoy my wealth; I could rent a plane and go off for a week.  But at the end of the day, I would be alone doing that, because I never lead that kind of life with people who are able to do that.  And I don’t even have so strong a spirit of adventure.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On seeing himself back on television in 1992, realized that he had gotten fat and began to diet] So I began a strict diet for a week, and lost about six pounds.  I don’t think it was that that changed me so much, I think it was a psychological thing.  What affected me physically was that I wanted to be different.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I like living with luxury, but I am not greedy for it.  I like it, but I am removed, because I know all this is temporary; at some point, I have to leave these things because I am going to die.  So I begin to prepare psychologically for this event.  I could be very possessive, because I am a Cancer, so I am training my brain to leave earthly things.  I am training myself to live the life still left with a different psychology.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am enjoying the subtle things of life.  With this crazy race that I did to make myself known – to have some power, to have a position in the world, to have a name – maybe I often forgot some values that could seem less important but at the end give you a great deal of serenity.  So I am learning to value even the simplest things in life: it could be a sentence; it could be a gesture, a way of dressing some woman; it could be the kindness of a look.  Appreciating the things that I had forgotten.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his relationship with his former partner Sergio Galeotti who had passed away] It was a relationship of great complicity.  A strong understanding.  Without many words, we understood each other on everything: what we loved, what we didn’t love…
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Sergio Galeotti] There was a lot of courage on his part, which I was lacking, being more adult and therefore more cautious.  He had a great deal of strength, and maybe even some form or irresponsibility.  And I operated with a dose of realism, and maybe even a little genius that has been very useful to me in my life.  
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t much like rings on a man…
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think that it is a little more difficult for somebody who started off by designing underwear to move up to another product, as opposed to someone like me, who started doing an almost-couture line and then worked down to also doing underwear.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Fashion is finished; for me, the diktat is finished.  That is, ‘This is fashion, and you must dress this way.’  It’s finished.  Fashion is what a woman makes: She puts on an Armani jacket, a skirt by Gigli.  This is fashion.  It’s old-fashioned when the magazines have this diktat.  Old.  
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1996] In the last ten years, too much has been done too fast, with everybody always looking out for something new; so every season there has to be something new, and everything was changing so quickly.  So in the past ten years, everything has been done – so much has been done.  And this is the negative side of fashion, in a sense, that has made it a bit ridiculous today, I think.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People don’t need a lot.  They need much less – much, much less – than what we who make fashion think, or you who write about it.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1993 on his ‘Gio’ perfume] Gio is the perfume expression of the principles that govern my life.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Luxury is knowing how to live in harmony with oneself and with others.  The first step toward serenity and simplicity is to overcome the superfluous.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Music is very much part of the Italian culture, and hip hop is the music of today – the music that young people all over the world really respond to.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People who have become successful in music, art, dance, or cinema have more than just good talent, they have charisma and a certain quality that inspires others.
<BR><a href="giorgio-armani-quotes.html">Giorgio Armani<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Fashion is all about instinct and a feeling for what’s going on around you.
