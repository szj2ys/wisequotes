<BR>
<BR>
[During World War II.] You would think that serving food to Generals in Guadalcanal wouldn’t have much relevance later on, but it taught me to estimate how much food was needed based on the number of people served.  That knowledge gave me confidence to start a restaurant.  Even menial work has lessons that you can build on, if you look at them and put them to use.
<BR><a href="glen-bell-quotes.html">Glen Bell<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="glen-bell-quotes.html">Glen Bell<a/>
