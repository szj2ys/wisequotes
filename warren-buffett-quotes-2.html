I know people who have a lot of money, and they get testimonial dinners and they get hospital wings named after them.  But the truth is that nobody in the world loves them.  If you get to my age in life and nobody thinks well of you, I don’t care how big your bank account is, your life is a disaster.  That’s the ultimate test of how you have lived your life.  The trouble with love is that you can’t buy it.  You can buy sex.  You can buy testimonial dinners.  You can buy pamphlets that say how wonderful you are.  But the only way to get love is to be loveable.  It’s very irritating if you have a lot of money.  You’d like to think you could write a check: I’ll buy a million dollars of love.  But it doesn’t work that way.  The more you give love away, the more you get.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>[In 2004] Our capital is underutilised now.  It’s a painful condition to be in, but not as painful as doing something stupid.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>A man who tries to carry a cat home by it’s tail will learn a lesson that can be learned in no other way.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>[On risk management] The time to have considered – and improved – the reliability of New Orleans’s levees was before [Hurricane] Katrina.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>[Investing in Korea when USD overvalued and Korean companies cheap] They make basic products like steel, cement, flour and electricity.  Which people will be buying in 10 years.  They have a big market share in Korea which isn’t going to change… This flour company has more than it’s market value in cash, and sells at three times earnings.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>When you invest, you have to take some risk.  The future is always uncertain.  I think a group of these stocks will do very well for several years.  Some of them may not do well, but as a group they should do well.  I could end up owning them for several years.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Philanthropy is harder than business.  You are tackling important problems that people with intellect and money have tackled in the past and had a tough time solving.  So the search for talent in philanthropy should be even more important than the search for talent in investments, where the game is not as tough.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>You have to think about things that have never happened before.  You always want to have plenty of money around.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>There are always people who say that the rules have changed.  But it only looks that way, if the time horizon is too short.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>The purpose of life is to be loved by as many people as possible among those you want to have love you.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>The snowball just happens if you’re in the right kind of snow, and that’s what happened with me.  I don’t just mean compounding money either.  It’s in terms of understanding the world and what kind of friends you accumulate.  You get to select over time , and you’ve got to be the kind of person that the snow wants to attach itself to.  You’ve go to be your own wet snow, in effect.  You’d better be picking up snow as you go along, because you’re not going to be getting back up to the top of the hill again.  That’s the way life works.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Diversification is a protection against ignorance.  It makes very little sense for those who know what they are doing.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Doing very little is more profitable.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Happiness comes from small improvements, not by getting somewhere once and for all.  Being able to add on one room to your house is what makes you happy, not living in a palace.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>My job is to keep a group of 15-20 managers enthused about what they are doing, because most of them are already wealthy beyond their belief.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>The inescapable fact is that the value of an asset, whatever it’s character, cannot over the long term grow faster than its earnings.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Buffett once was seen picking up a 1 cent piece on an elevator on his way to the office and remarked to the stunned witnesses ‘The beginning of the next billion.’.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Charlie and I have not learned how to solve difficult business problems.  What we have learned is to avoid them.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>It’s not that I want money.  It’s the fun of making money and watching it grow.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>The market is there only as a reference point to see if anybody is offering to do anything foolish.  When we invest in stocks, we invest in businesses.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Investment is an activity of forecasting the yield on assets over the life of the asset.  Speculation is the activity of forecasting the psychology of the market.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>There is also another alternative:  Don’t do anything.  More fortunes are made by sitting on good securities for years at a time than by active trading.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>The stock market is a no called strike game.  You don’t have to swing at everything – you can wait for your pitch.  The problem when you’re a money manager is that your fans keep yelling, ‘Swing you bum’.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>We don’t get paid for activity, just for being right.  As to how long we’ll wait, we’ll wait indefinitely.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>The most common cause of low prices is pessimism – sometimes pervasive, some times specific to a company or industry.  We want to do business in such an environment, not because we like pessimism but because we like the prices it produces.  It’s optimism that is the enemy of the rational buyer.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Price fluctuations are there to provide opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply, other times you would do better to forget the market and pay attention to the operating results of companies.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>In my opinion, investment success will not be produced by arcane formulae, computer programs or signals flashed by the price behaviour of stocks and markets.  Rather an investor will succeed by coupling good business judgement with an ability to insulate his thoughts and behaviour from the super-contagious emotions that swirl about the marketplace.  In my own efforts to stay insulated, I have found it highly useful to keep Ben’s Mr Market concept firmly in mind.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>If a company’s future cannot be predicted, it cannot be valued.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>I never talk to brokers or analysts.  Wall Street is the only place that people who ride to work in a Rolls Royce get advice from those who take the subway.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Don’t own a stock for 10 minutes if you don’t plan to own it for 10 years.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Investing is about the study of human nature.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>As one of the Indianapolis ‘500’ winners said: ‘To finish first you must first finish’.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with the 130 IQ.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>If you believe your gain, weighted for probabilities, considerably exceeds your loss, comparably weighted, you may consciously purchase a risky investment.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>A parent company that owns a subsidiary with superb long-term economics will not sell the company’s ‘crown jewel’.  Yet this same CEO will impulsively sell stocks in his personal portfolio with little more logic than ‘You can’t go broke taking a profit’.  In our view what makes sense in business also makes sense in stocks.  An investor should ordinarily hold a small piece of an outstanding business with the same tenacity that an owner would exhibit if he owned all of that business.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Forecasts may tell you a great deal about the forecaster; they tell you nothing about the future.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR>Investing Rule Number 1: Never lose money.  Investing Rule Number 2: Never forget Rule Number 1.<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="warren-buffett-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="warren-buffett-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="warren-buffett-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="warren-buffett-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="warren-buffett-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="warren-buffett-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="warren-buffett-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="warren-buffett-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="warren-buffett-quotes-10.html">10<a/>  </p><p><BR>
