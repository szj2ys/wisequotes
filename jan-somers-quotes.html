Property is a bit like kids and dogs – they are not perfect.  We do not live in a perfect world, so to go out and expect to find the perfect property is simply not reality.  There is no such thing as a property that has the best growth, the best yield, the perfect aspect and the most desirable location.  You are not going to find all of those attributes in a property all at once, it simply doesn’t exist.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>

<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps patience is a lost virtue, but it’s patience you need to build real wealth.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People who succeed financially are those who are able to delay gratification, and patiently follow the surer, slower paths to riches.
<BR><a href="jan-somers-quotes.html">Jan Somers<a/>
