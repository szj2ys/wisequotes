<BR>
[On describing success early on as] A pyramiding of power of control.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his overlapping partnership structure of News Limited allowing him to reinvest profits back into his various operations instead of being required by the banks to pay out dividends to shareholders] In this way, a central bank in London or Australia can’t order you to pay dividends, since you don’t have control stock.  It means you can plow back profits.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1981] I am not seeking to acquire these papers in order to change them into something entirely different.  Whatever proposals for progress may be developed, there will be no fundamental change in the characteristics.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was very passionate about Australia.  It was special, it was different.  I would very much like to remain an Australian citizen, because I have built what I consider a very big Australian company around the world.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being asked why he had decided to become a US citizen] Because I wanted to be, and I’m very happy and very gratified.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am not a monopolist as some claim.  I have given people choice.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m considered an old fashioned but I consider that the family with a father, a mother and children is absolutely fundamental to our civilisation.  Not just in America.  But everywhere.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is sometimes hard to hear yourself think over the noise of grinding axes as our competitors cloak their pleas for protection and special privilege in the language of public interest.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On why the ‘Coalition of the Willing’ should not pull out of Iraq] We have no alternative – we must see the job through.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I figured [Mort Zuckerman] would assume that I would assume that he was misleading me, and would never print what would have been a great scoop.  So I did.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On President Bush in February 2003] Will either go down in history as a very great president or he’ll crash and burn.  I’m optimistic it will be the former by a ratio of 2 to 1… One senses he is a man of great character and deep humility.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Advances in the technology of telecommunications have proved an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere.  Some even see the Internet allowing democracy of a more participatory nature than at any time since the ancient Greeks.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I try to keep in touch with the details… I also look at the product daily.  That doesn’t mean you interfere, but it’s important occasionally to show the ability to be involved.  It shows you understand what’s happening.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ll stop Google taking our news.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On News of the World] The people I trusted have betrayed the company and betrayed me.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On naming another Sun exclusive on cricketer Ian Botham in 1987] Bloody Botham Bastard Bugger Mother Evil Satanist KGB.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I felt a loner at school, probably because of my father’s position.  Bullied a lot… It make me realise that if you’re going to do your job as a publisher or a principal in the media, you’ve got to be your own person and not have close friendships which can compromise you.  That philosophy just evolved, I think.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father Sir Keith Murdoch] I was twenty-one when he died, so I never had the opportunity to work alongside him, which was a very hard thing.  But I saw him work in my early teenage years.  I would go in on Saturday morning and watch him.  In Melbourne, the big Saturday-night papers were a big deal.  It just never occurred to me to do anything else.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I just want to say that I was brought up by a father who was not rich, but who was a great journalist… Just before he died, he bought a small paper, specifically in his will saying that he was giving me the chance to do good.  I remember what he did and what he was most product of, and for which he was hated in this country by many people for many, many years, was exposing the scandal at Gallipoli, which I remain very, very proud of.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I can go into restaurants and a whole table will get up and clap if they recognise me, because they love Fox News.  Other places – or even the same place – people will turn the other way.  But that’s okay.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>

<BR>
<BR>
If you run a media company, you hand out criticism.  You disclose things that people don’t want disclosed, because you think it’s in the public interest.  You’re disliked for that.  You get criticised and you just gotta learn to take it.  You just gotta shrug it off.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I want to give it greater critical mass.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
All over the world ad revenues are shrinking…
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Tighten your belt where you can and… hunker down.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Looking back we have bought things sometimes very expensively, sometimes cheaply.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The Fox network we started from nothing.  Sky television was absolutely a startup.  Pretty much a pirate startup.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Sky television being a pirate startup and beaming into Britain] We got a licence from Luxembourg and beamed into Britain.  It’s an independent company now but a very strong one.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On what’s missing from his business equation] Things that aren’t totally dependent on advertising.  Eg. Subscriptions.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We’re there first and best.  Establishing our brand names.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[The] European Union Commission… regulates everything that moves.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Germany in 2001] It’s a complicated area to work in.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On regulation] I hate it when it’s unnecessary.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There are times I believe in the anti-trust laws and anti-price fixing laws.  The public is well served by those laws when they’re properly administered.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On becoming a US citizen] The timing was admittedly for business reasons.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Australia] I enjoy going back there once a year.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My father died when I was only 21.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father Sir Keith Arthur Murdoch] Not that he was particularly religious.  He had the Calvinist views of hard-work, of service, and that if you were in the media you had a higher calling than being in the soap manufacturing business.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You really had a duty to say what you thought to be fair, but certainly to provide discussion and to give a lead…
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On owning a media enterprise being a higher calling] Oh absolutely!
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The responsibility to tell the truth, to spread the truth and all the facts you can.
<BR><a href="rupert-murdoch-quotes.html">Rupert Murdoch<a/>
