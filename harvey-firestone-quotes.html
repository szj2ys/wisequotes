I notice that when all a man’s information is confined to the field in which he is working, the work is never as good as it ought to be.

<BR><a href="harvey-firestone-quotes.html">Harvey Firestone<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The big profit in a new idea goes to the man who gets in first on the market, if he outlines the proper program.  The public can be educated about the value of rubber tires, and it is the business of the man who makes them to find a way to put them out at a price low enough so people cannot afford not to buy them.

To me the market was without limit, because the country was full of vehicles, and every man who owned a carriage was a possible prospect.  That’s the way it looked to my optimistic mind.
<BR><a href="harvey-firestone-quotes.html">Harvey Firestone<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is one thing to have a sound idea, and still another to pull it over.
<BR><a href="harvey-firestone-quotes.html">Harvey Firestone<a/>
