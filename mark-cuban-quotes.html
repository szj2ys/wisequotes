<BR>
When a stock doesn’t pay dividends, there really isn’t a whole lot of difference between a share of stock and a baseball card.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Patience is not a virtue on Wall Street.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>

<BR>
Diversification – that’s for idiots.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>

<BR>
If you are ready to compete with the big guys, you are ready to compete with anyone else.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Other guys play fantasy sports.  I fire the synapses to get an edge.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the threats in any business is that you outsmart yourself.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I read books about successful people.  In fact, I read every book or magazine I could get my hands on.  I would tell myself that one good idea would pay for the book and could make the difference between me making it or not.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2008] The best time for little guys to start a business is when the big guys are worrying about surviving in theirs.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going to work hung over once a week isn’t a good career move.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I knew I had taken a few classes in real-world business and got paid for it instead of paying tuition…
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m a terrible employee.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I realized I had to get off my ass and make something happen.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I used to tell myself that it was okay to make little mistakes as long as I didn’t make the big ones.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A guy with a minimal computer background could compete with far more experienced guys just because he put in the time to learn all he could.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If I could come out of nowhere and be successful at the age of 24, so can you!
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I would learn later in life, money makes you extremely handsome.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>

Always run your business like you are going to be competing with biggest technology companies in your industry – Google, Facebook, Oracle, Microsoft, whomever.  They may not be your direct competitors.  They may be a vendor.  They may be a direct competitor and a vendor.  Whatever they may be to your business, if you are in the technology business in any shape or form, you have to anticipate that you will have to compete with them at some point.  I ask myself every week what I would do if they entered any of my businesses.  If you are ready to compete with the big guys, you are ready to compete with anyone else.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>

I love to compete.  I always have.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Relaxing is for the other guy.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t like companies that sell products that consumers shouldn’t buy.  It catches up at some point.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had so many jobs my parents wondered if I would ever be stable.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In every job, I would justify in my mind, whether I loved it or hated it, that I was getting paid to learn and every experience would be of value when I figured out what I wanted to do when I grew up.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is time to get paid to learn.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>

[In May 2012] I always laugh at all the pundits /analysts who try to tell you what any non dividend paying stock is worth.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most people think it’s all about the idea.  It’s not.  EVERYONE has ideas.  The hard part is doing the homework to know if the idea could work in an industry, then doing the preparation to be able to execute on the idea.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Do your homework and know your business better than anyone.  Otherwise, someone who knows more and works harder will kick your ass.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you won’t put your money in the bank, NEVER put your money in something where you don’t have an information advantage.  Why invest your money in something because a broker told you to?  If the broker had a clue, he/she wouldn’t be a broker, they would be on a beach somewhere.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s always the little decisions that have the biggest impact.  Do it because you love it.  Then it’s not a job.  I’m a geek.  I love technology.  I would be online working with technology regardless of what my day job is.  
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Every kids thinks they have something special about themselves.  Every adult thinks they have a big idea at some point of their life.  
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Make your product easier to buy than your competition, or you will find your customers buying from them, not you.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Next time you blow a demo or presentation remember the lights went out on MNF on ESPN… twice.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Make a boatload of money.  Pay your taxes.  Lots of taxes.  Hire people.  Train people.  Pay people.  Spend money on rent, equipment, services.  Pay more taxes.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I can’t tell you how many times I have been asked to write a book.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t want to write a book.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m young.  I’m fun.  I’m marginally ugly and I have a great family.  
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m just beginning to get good.  It is too early to write a book.
<BR><a href="mark-cuban-quotes.html">Mark Cuban<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is my wish for you to recognize that if I can become the luckiest person in the world, then with a little bit of work, and yes some luck, you can give me a run for my money…
