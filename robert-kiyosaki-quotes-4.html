Getting rich has everything to do with desire, drive, determination, study, friends, advisors, and how bad you want to be rich.  It’s easy to be a rich expert in your own backyard.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>When people ask why we keep working when we no longer have to, the reason is because our work gives our lives means.  Work is our passion.  Work helps fulfil our life purpose and it gives our lives meaning because we believe our work is important and vital.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Anyone can be rich by being greedy.  Having a high financial IQ means knowing how to be a generous person. <BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>If you teach yourself and others to be rich, you can become richer, regardless of how big or small your paycheck is.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The secret to becoming richer was simply teaching others what I wanted to learn.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>You cannot teach a poor person to be rich.  You can only teach someone who wants to learn to be rich, to be rich.  Many people want money but very few people want to learn to be rich.  That is why there are so few rich people.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>In July of 2005 the government of Japan informed it’s younger workers that they will have to pay more in taxes to pay for the older workers’ retirement.  We in America may be getting the same news in a few years.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>You will not become rich until you teach others to be rich.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Was that why he was rich?  In teaching me to be rich was he also teaching himself to be richer?  ‘Of course.  I’m not doing this just for you, I’m doing this for me.  I learn something everytime I teach.  We may not be learning the same things, but I too am learning.  There have been many a time I’ve been teaching you or Mike and suddenly a new idea pops into my head, or I see something completely differently.  There has been many a time I have solved my own problems helping you solve your own problems.’<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Teach what you want to learn.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The more I teach, the more I learn.  The more I learn, the better teacher I become.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The purpose is to be a student who teaches other students to be free from the slavery of money and from those who seek to control their money.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Passion is essential for success.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Everytime I find myself having difficulty solving a problem, be it a financial, business, or personal problem, I remind myself of his [Einstein –‘Imagination is more important than knowledge.’] and shift to the use of my imagination.  I have come to realise that problems are only symptoms of rational thinking and an uncreative mind.  In other words, the only reason a problem is a problem is because I am using and old solution to solve a new problem.  To solve a new problem requires imagination, intuition, faith, and a love of adventure.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Every professional investor knows they will occasionally make a mistake and make a bad investment.  So professionals know that cutting your losses, as early as possible, is always a strategic option you keep in your bag of tricks.  People who need to be right or refuse to admit they made a mistake, often hold onto their losses, refusing to let go.  The tricky part is to know when it it’s time to cut your losses.  Some people quit too early, some quit too late, and some never quit at all.  Amateurs tend to hold onto losers forever because they don’t want to admit they made a mistake.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Anyone can work hard for money.  It takes a person with a high financial IQ to have their money work hard.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Being generous, rather than greedy, is one of the better ways of getting rich.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>As long as I have cashflowing in, I can sleep at night, whether the market is going up or going down.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Watch the historical, long-trends, have a big picture view, and be patient.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Humans need to give.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>I don’t know a successful person alive who didn’t also fail a lot at the beginning.  The fear of failure is always lurking in the background of the mind, waiting to sabotage one’s success.  If you pretend it’s not there, you can’t deal with it.  Acknowledge it.  Then move forward and do your best.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Knowledge + ACTION = Results.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Many lazy people are hard-working people.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>It is easier to be busy at work than it was to do what I needed to do.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>My rich dad was a rich man because he did not work hard for money.  Instead he worked hard at having his money work hard for him.  The harder his money worked, the more money he made, and the more free time he had.  The more free time he had, the more money he made.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>See what most people cannot see.  See opportunities most people cannot see because of fear.  See the destination and the journey.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>One of the reasons I have a team of advisors when I invest is simply that each person sees something different.  After listening to what each person has to say, I then make up my own mind.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>How many investments can you afford if you lose money each month?<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>I get richer by failing.  I found out that people who do not fail also do not succeed.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>People are trainable.  They can be trained to be either employees or entrepreneurs.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>If you want freedom you need to let go of security.  Employees desire security and entrepreneurs seek freedom.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR> ‘So the secret to your business success is being willing to make mistakes and then learning from them?’ Yes.  That is my job as an entrepreneur.  My job is to set new goals, create a plan, make mistakes and risk failing.  The more mistakes I make, the smarter I become and hopefully the company grows and prospers from the lessons learned.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>I start new businesses even if I succeed.  That is why I have so many businesses, business that run without me.  That is my secret to great wealth.  Most employees have one job.  As an entrepreneur, I have multiple businesses.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Don’t ask yourself why?  Ask yourself why not?<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Work to learn, not to earn.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Sometimes we win the most when we have nothing to lose.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Success reveals your failures.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Each failure was actually making me smarter and more confident.  Each failure made me less afraid of failing and more excited about learning what I needed to learn next.  Each failure was a challenge, the door to the next world.  If I was successful, the door to the next world opened.  If I failed and the challenge beat me, the door slammed in my face.  If the door slammed in my face, it meant I needed to get smarter.  I needed to think harder.  I needed to use my creativity to find a way to get into the next door.  In many ways, it was like being a salesman on the street again, knocking on doors once more.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-6.html">6<a/> </p><p><BR>
