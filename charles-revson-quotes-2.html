If you’ve not, you’re nobody.  You never will be.  You think you are?  Fine.  Love it.  Go on-have happiness, have love, have this, have everything.

I used to walk into a store and sell some bullsh*t, and walk out of the store and say, ‘Hey that’s pretty good.’  So I went back and bought the bullsh*t back for more than I sold it for so I could use it again to sell it for even more than I paid for it.
