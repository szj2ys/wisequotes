When we came up with the name ‘Virgin’ instead of ‘Slipped Disc’ Records for our record company in the winter of 1969, I had some vague idea of the name being catchy and applying to lots of other products for young people.  It would have been interesting to have tracked the success of the Virgin companies or otherwise if we had called the company Slipped Disc Records.  Slipped Disc Condoms might not have worked as well.

<BR>
<BR>
If you can run one business well, you can run any business well.
