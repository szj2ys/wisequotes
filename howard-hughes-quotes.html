I would also like to be happily married.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> [The first thing Howard Hughes said after barely escaping death during a crash landing in a beet field after setting a new airspeed record for land planes] She’ll do better than this, Odie.  She’ll do three-sixty-five; I just know it.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> I’m going to build an airline that makes American look like the third-rate outfit it is.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> I have learned you cannot fulfil a great purpose like the building of Nevada and make ice-cream on the front porch every night too.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> You cannot cry about what is not and never will be.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> Keep in mind, I’m a mere mortal – not some Greek God down from Olympus.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> I’m not a paranoid deranged millionaire. Goddamit, I’m a billionaire.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR> There is nothing that interests me more than medical research and the quest for better living facilities, and better health and better medical standards, not only in the United States, but throughout the world.  This, to me is where we should be concentrating our greatest efforts.  In fact, possibly – I might say that I feel it could be more important than some of the space activity.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> [On the spruce goose] There is no airplane in the world that I know of that is as big dimensionally and what we truthfully call bigness.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> [On the ‘Spruce Goose’ flying boat] I put the blood of my life into this thing.  I have my reputation rolled up in it, and I have stated that if it was a failure I probably will leave this country and never come back, and I mean it.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR>  [On flying the largest plane ‘Spruce Goose’ in the world in 1947.  One that people said would never fly together with reporter James McNamara] ‘We were really up in the air.  We were really up in the air.  Howard did you expect that?’ [Said James McNamara]  Certainly, I like to think surprises.  I thought I might have surprised.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> Today I want to speak about the time toward which I look when the word luck and everything that goes with it will have no place in any phase of flying.  When aviation will have found it’s rightful position among the other precise and scientific developments of the age such as industrial chemistry, the electric light and the telephone.  A useful tool built and controlled by man to do his exact bidding.  <BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> I look ahead to the day when you will lean out of a New York skyscraper window and see a great ship perhaps not as large as the Queen Mary but larger than some of the ships flying the Atlantic today.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> This is a business.  The purpose of a business is to make money.  If it happens to make art, too, that would be secondary and accidental.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> [On the future of aviation] It is only the future in which I am really vitally interested.  <BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> [On flying around the world in July 1938.]  Just before we took off from Floyd Bennett field ten days ago a women ran out to the plane and stuck a piece of chewing gum on the tail.  According to a long standing superstition this is supposed to bring good luck.  Now this piece of chewing gum went around the world with us and returned to Floyd Bennett field.  Whether it’s owner retrieved it or not I do not know.  Furthermore I do not know how much it had to do with our getting back safely.  But I do know that luck played a part in this flight, considerably more of a part than I had hoped it would play.  But let me say this on that connection that the time when luck played the greatest part was owing to an error in judgement on my part.  It certainly played no part in the navigation of the plane which was beyond reproach.  <BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> I want to be remembered for only one thing – my contribution to aviation.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR> Now will you give me the questions in advance that you want to ask me while I am here?<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> [In response to a Senator’s request.] No I don’t think I will.  I don’t think I’ll try.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> When Senator Brewster realised that he was fighting a ballet against public opinion, a losing battle he folded up and took a runout power.  Yes that was the tip off when Senator Brewster hit the road for the backwoods of main, that meant the hearing was over.  Washington was too hot for him.  He couldn’t take it.  After that the other senators on this committee saw no reason to fight Brewsters losing battle for him if he was too cowardly to stay and face the music.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> Once you consent to some concession, you can never cancel it and put things back the way they are.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> The trouble with my life is that I do not think I am cut out to sit behind a desk.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> [On Terry Moore eating ice-cream, cookies and peanuts.]  This will ruin your figure and your career.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> I’m going to turn this gal into a sex symbol.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> No!  Never check an interesting fact!<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> A lot of people, they’re looking for any crack in my armor.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> Bob [Maheu], I want you to look around and see how many of these hotels and casinos are for sale.  Let’s buy as many as we can.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR> I would be ecstatic at the prospect of purchasing Parvin in the same manner as Air West. Do you think this really could be accomplished? I just assumed that the cries of monopoly would rule it out.  If this really could be accomplished, I think it would be a ten strike and might change all of my plans.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> I would expect you really to wrap that government up down there to a point where it would be – well – a captive entity in every way.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR>  ‘Rupert [His Uncle] told me that if I come to Hollywood, instead of ‘Samuel Goldwyn Presents’, signs will say ‘Howard Hughes Presents’.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> Surely your life can’t have covered all the plots you’re got to film.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> About all else, I want to be the most famous man in the world.  And I don’t care by what means I become famous, as long as fame comes.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> For the first time in my life, I’m free.  No one will ever again tell me what to do.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> Do I look like I’m wearing a mask?<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> I am my own man now, and I’ll go where I please and do what I please.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> I’m well aware of that, and it’ll make taking her all the sweeter.<BR><a href="howard-hughes-quotes.html">Howard Hughes<a/><BR><BR> I’m Howard Hughes Jr.  I want to buy that Bearcat [Roadster that could do the then incredible speed of ninety miles an hour].  I don’t care what it costs.
