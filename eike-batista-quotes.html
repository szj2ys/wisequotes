Failures only make you grow.

<BR>
<BR>
In mining you go to some crazy place, you set up a camp.  You start looking for water and energy and this way you can build anything.  That’s the mind-set.  That’s my life.  That’s how I started from zero.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>

My mother taught me discipline – she was German, from Hamburg – and so she taught me discipline and care, caring for others, which is very much what I got from her, which forged me in many ways.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I was eleven or twelve I had asthma.  My mother said I think you could cure this through swimming.  And she kept throwing me into a swimming pool to the point that I solved my asthma problem.  That was added stress in my life, and it makes you tougher.

<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>

<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
After two and a half years at Aachen University in Germany I realized that I already had a grasp on the engineering part of the world, so I wanted to make money.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I owned a motorbike that went 90 to 100 kilometers an hour.  I spent hours trying to make it faster.  
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1989, when I decided to race powerboats in Brazil, I became the Brazilian, the American and the world champion because of two things: understanding how to build a team and smart engineering.  It’s a very dangerous sport and a five-cent piece could make you lose the race or even die.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
From the 1960s to the 1980s, my father was very busy building the international offices of Vale, the Brazilian steel giant.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What my father taught me, what I learned from him, is to think big, because he built – there’s a movie in Brazil called Brazil’s Engineer, and it’s about him, because he built part of Brazil’s macro-infrastructure – railways, super ports for shipment of iron ore to Asia, back then to Japan.  And so I learned to think.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m one of seven children, the second.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I began selling insurance…This taught me how to talk to people.  Some doors open and some do not.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A brutal desire to be financially independent.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I tell young people, especially middle and upper-class youngsters, that parents should not make it too easy for them.  We pamper them too much.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On him selling insurance] Within a month, I made more than double what I needed by selling insurance.  I bought an old Mercedes, so when I drove up to the doors I could show off.  
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I went to visit the Amazon in the northern part of Brazil, where lots of pick-and-shovel miners were producing lots of gold.  It was like the old Wild West.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What I realized was that a lot of gold was being produced and so my idea was to become a trader, to buy and sell the gold.  I didn’t want to initially participate in the gold production because local owners who had the planes and controlled the landing strips to move the gold out controlled it.  The mules of the jungle were Cessna 186 planes.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I went to two jewelers in Rio and asked them to lend me some money.  I said I would bring the gold to Rio and Sao Paulo from the Amazon.  Somehow, they liked what I said and obviously it was gold, you know.  I don’t think they would have given me any money if I asked them to buy chocolate. 
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On borrowing money from two jewelers to buy gold] They charged me 20 percent interest rate on the money and also wanted some of the product.  So they wanted a double-interest.  But in eighteen months, I managed to buy $60 million in gold and, after discounting everything, I was left with a net of 10 percent.  So I made $6 million when I was twenty-two years of age.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[After he had made $6 million] What happened was that during that time other traders started to come into the area and I saw very clearly that my 10 percent margin was going to go sharply down to perhaps 2 percent or 3 percent.  I said, ‘Well, it’s time to think about something else.’  So looking at these pick-and-shovel miners producing gold very inefficiently, I decided I am going to buy one of these sites from an owner and mechanize the production of gold.  So I bought a mine for $2 million and the first thing I did was I hired a Canadian drilling company that specialized in drilling alluvial deposits.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was down to my last $300,000 because I had obviously under-estimated logistics, diseases, and mechanical problems… It was very stressful, I must tell you.
<BR><a href="eike-batista-quotes.html">Eike Batista<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had to airlift the gold out.  The closest road was 100 kilometers from the mine…
