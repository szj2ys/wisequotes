One has to remember that every failure can be a stepping-stone to something better…

<BR>
<BR>
[On not starting KFC until he was 65 and selling it for $2 million in 1964] I just say the moral out of my life is don’t quit at age 65, maybe your boat hasn’t come in yet.  Mine hadn’t.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On selling Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC)] At seventy four I sold, for the sum of two million dollars, my fried chicken business, which I’d started at the age of sixty five, when I was getting ready to live out my days on social security.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At age 65] My life isn’t over and I’m not going to sit in a rocking chair and take money from the government.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think each of the failures I had to face provided me with the opportunity of starting again and trying something new.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I never limited myself to serving gas.  I also repaired flat tires that customers left at the station.  The service station was open until 9 o’clock, then when I closed I repaired the inner tubes.  Sometimes I didn’t finish working until 1 or 2 o’clock in the morning.  Then I opened again at 5 a.m.  Most gas stations didn’t open until 7, and I sold more gas between 5 and 7 in the morning than the other stations sold all day.

<BR>
There’s no reason to be the richest man in the cemetery.  You can’t do any business there.
<BR>There’s no reason to be the richest man in the cemetery.  You can’t do any business from there.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I really do not see why someone who is dying would leave an amount of half a million or a million dollars to his successors when he knows that an immense percentage will go to taxes.  
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You’ve got to like your work.  
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The easy way rests hazardously upon shifting sands, whereas the hard way builds solidly a foundation…
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If there was anything that got Kentucky Fried Chicken off the ground, it was gambling on radio’s unsold time.  We had to change equipment practically every day for two weeks just to cook enough chicken to satisfy demand.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you’re a dreamer and a do’er back up your dreams.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being told ‘Colonel come on in and get out of the rain’] Don’t worry about this rain some farmer is happy to have this rain.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you follow the formula and the procedures shown… your success is assured.  There’s no question about it.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Have ambition to work, willingness to work and integrity in what you do.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being rejected 1,009 times before selling the first KFC franchise in 1952] So many other people have strived through adversity that it will embarrass you.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Said for two years and receiving 1,009 ‘no’s’ for his KFC recipe] I’ve got a great chicken recipe and I think if you use it, it’s increase your sales.  
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I work, I forget my little aches and pains.  When I’m really busy, I forget I ever had an ache.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People will rust out quicker than they’ll ever wear out, and I’ll be darned if I’ll ever rust out.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Once a man and twice a child.

I still believe in the importance of charity, which means giving to God his just measure of goods he has seen fit to bestow on you in the form of material gain.  When I started out in the franchise business, I didn’t know exactly what I was doing by promising God his part if he helped make my enterprise a success, but I now think that that is the reason for my success ever since.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to help people.  At the time of the W.P.A. (Work Project Administration) I aided a number of families, even though I was poor myself.  I have always given money to the church, and supported religious works.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you’ve got time to lean, you’ve got time to clean.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I pray to the Almighty to encourage you to dedicate your life to Jesus Christ.  Whatever difficulties you may have to face, turn to him, recognize him and render him all your glory, and he will help you overcome.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I really do not see why someone who is dying would leave an amount of half a million or a million dollars to his successors when he knows that an immense percentage will go to taxes.  That’s why I gave my Canadian subsidiary to a charitable foundation.  The other reason, as I have said, is that I wanted to do something for God.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe that you have to plan your retirement, not by thinking that you will be deprived of something, but rather that something will be added to your life.  You see, you do not start from zero, you are rich with the totality of experience that life has given to you.  The past years are like a crown which you wear at the beginning of the next phase of your life.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
For me, money is not everything.  As I have already said, I was more interested in doing good and helping people.  It’s like the Rotary Club slogan that induced me to become a member more than 50 years ago: ‘Service first.’
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
This title of Colonel before my name is like the honourable Sir in front of yours, my dear Sir Lawyer.  It means absolutely nothing.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The chicken I served and which appeared on the menu was seasoned with herbs and spices; it was so superior to ordinary fried chicken, it was so delicious and satisfying, that I didn’t dare add another ingredient to the recipe for fear of ruining a good thing, and alienating my clients who would not appreciate the change, and who would not come back to the restaurant afterwards.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The easy way is efficacious and speedy, the hard way arduous and long.  But, as the clock ticks, the easy way becomes harder and the hard way becomes easier.  And as the calendar records the years, it becomes increasingly evident that the easy way rests hazardously upon shifting sands, whereas the hard way builds solidly a foundation of confidence that cannot be swept away.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You’ve got to like your work.  You’ve got to like what you are doing, you’ve got to be doing something worthwhile so you can like it – because if it’s worthwhile, that makes a difference, don’t you see?
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At age ten being fired and told by the neighbour ‘You’re not worth a doggone, boy.’ Which was to change him.] I remember my mother saying ‘I’m afraid you’re just no good.  Here I am, left alone with you three children to support, and you won’t even work enough so somebody will keep you.  I guess I’ll never be able to count on you.’
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On finding his wife Josephine had moved out and given away all the furniture but after that staying together for thirty-nine years of marriage before divorcing.] That hurt me.  I figured she didn’t have any right to take my children and give away my furniture.  But I didn’t know anything to do about it.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[After selling KFC] It’s my face that’s shown on that box of chicken and in the advertising.  It’s me that people recognize, and they stop me everywhere I go to complain.  The damn SOBs don’t know anything but peddling booze, and they sure as hell don’t know a damn thing about good food.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1976 after selling KFC]  The worst fried chicken I’ve ever seen… 
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the KFC gravy] Nothing more than wallpaper paste.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1976 after selling KFC] My God!  They buy tap water for fifteen or twenty cents a thousand gallons and then mix it with flour and starch and end up with wallpaper paste.  That stuff is sludge… there’s no way you could get me to eat some of those potatoes…you’re just working for a company that doesn’t know what it’s doing.  Too bad, because it gives you a bad reputation.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I came back from the Army in February of 1907 I came to Sheffield Alabama and went to work in the shop as a blacksmith helper.  I worked there for about two months.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Early job] Cleaning ashtrays in automobiles preparing them for the next day trips.
<BR><a href="colonel-sanders-quotes.html">Colonel Sanders<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think a dream is just a suggestion to start something out, do something.
