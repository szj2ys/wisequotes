<BR>
You can shed tears that she is gone, 
or you can smile because she has lived. 
You can close your eyes and pray that she'll come back, 
or you can open your eyes and see all she's left. 
Your heart can be empty because you can't see her, 
or you can be full of the love you shared. 
You can turn your back on tomorrow and live yesterday, 
or you can be happy for tomorrow because of yesterday. 
You can remember her only that she is gone, 
or you can cherish her memory and let it live on. 
You can cry and close your mind, 
be empty and turn your back. 
Or you can do what she'd want: 
smile, open your eyes, love and go on. 
<BR><B>David Harkins</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
There are three needs of the griever: To find the words for the loss, to say the words aloud and to know that they words have been heard.
<BR><B>Victoria Alexander</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Love is a fabric that never fades, no matter how often it is washed in the waters of adversity and grief. 
<BR><B>Anon</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Grief can be a burden, but also an anchor. You get used to the weight, how it holds you in place.
<BR><B>Sarah Dessen</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Grief changes shape, but it never ends. 
<BR><B>Keanu Reeves</B>

Sorrow makes us all children again - destroys all differences of intellect.  The wisest know nothing.  
<BR><B>Ralph Waldo Emerson</B>
<BR>
<BR>
While grief is fresh, every attempt to divert only irritates. You must wait till it be digested, and then amusement will dissipate the remains of it.
<BR><B>Samuel Johnson</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
I still miss those I loved who are no longer with me but I find I am grateful for having loved them. The gratitude has finally conquered the loss. 
<BR><B>Rita Mae Brown</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. 
<BR><B>C S Lewis</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Grief is a normal and natural response to loss. It is originally an unlearned feeling process. Keeping grief inside increases your pain. 
<BR><B>Anne Grant</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nothing that grieves us can be called little; by the external laws of proportion a child's loss of a doll and a king's loss of a crown are events of the same size.  
<BR><B>Mark Twain</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Grief is a species of idleness.  
<BR><B>Samuel Johnson</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Grief is a process, not a state.
<BR><B>Anne Grant</B>
<BR>
<BR>
She was a genius of sadness, immersing herself in it, separating its numerous strands, appreciating its subtle nuances. She was a prism through which sadness could be divided into its infinite spectrum. 
<BR><B>Jonathan Safran Foer</B>
<BR>
<BR>
An important way to cope with grief is having an outlet, be it interpersonal, be it artistic, that will allow you to not have to contain your grief, but will give you an opportunity to express it, to externalize it to some degree. 
<BR><B>R Benyamin Cirlin</B>
<BR>
<BR>
One cannot get through life without pain...What we can do is choose how to use the pain life presents to us. 
<BR><B>Bernie S Siegel</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Grief is a process, not a state. 
<BR><B>Anne Grant</B>
<BR>

We must embrace pain and burn it as fuel for our journey.  
<BR><B>Kenji Miyazawa</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I don't mind dying, I just don't want to be there when it happens. Woody Allen
Grief does not change you, Hazel. It reveals you. 
<BR><B>John Green</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Grief is like a moving river, so that's what I mean by it's always changing. It's a strange thing to say because I'm at heart an optimistic person, but I would say in some ways it just gets worse. It's just that the more time that passes, the more you miss someone. 
<BR><B>Michelle Williams</B> 
<BR>

<BR>
Three things in human life are important: The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind.
<BR><B>Henry James</B>
<BR>
<BR>
If you're going through hell, keep going.  
<BR><B>Winston Churchill</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Do not stand 
at my grave and weep. 
I am not there. I do not sleep. 
I am a thousand winds 
that blow. 
I am the diamond glints on snow. 
I am the sunlight 
on ripened grain. 
I am the gentle autumn rain. 
When you awake in the 
morning's hush 
I am the soft uplifting rush 
of quiet birds in circling flight. 
I am the soft star that 
shines at night. 
Do not stand at my grave and cry 
I am not there. 
I did not die.
<BR><B>Anonymous</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
He that conceals his grief finds no remedy for it. 
<BR><B>Turkish Proverb</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Grief is not a disorder, a disease or a sign of weakness. It is an emotional, physical and spiritual necessity, the price you pay for love. The only cure for grief is to grieve. 
<BR><B>Earl Grollman</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Donâ€™t grieve. Anything you lose comes round in another form.
<BR><B>Rumi</B>
<BR>

Grief is perhaps an unknown territory for you. You might feel both helpless and hopeless without a sense of a "map" for the journey. Confusion is the hallmark of a transition. To rebuild both your inner and outer world is a major project. 
<BR><B>Anne Grant</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Grief never mended no broken bones.
<BR><B>Charles Dickens</B> 
<BR>

She was no longer wresting with the grief, but could sit down with it as a lasting companion and make it a sharer in her thoughts. 
<BR><B>George Eliot</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We acquire the strength we have overcome.  
<BR><B>Ralph Waldo Emerson</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The risk of love is loss, and the price of loss is grief -- But the pain of grief is only a shadow when compared with the pain of never risking love.
<BR><B>Hilary Stanton Zunin</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The darker the night, the brighter the stars, 
The deeper the grief, the closer is God!
<BR><B>Fyodor Dostoyevsky</B>
<BR>
<BR> 
I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless.
<BR><B>Elizabeth Barrett Browning</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Grief is the agony of an instant. The indulgence of grief the blunder of a life. 
<BR><B>Benjamin Disraeli</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Time is a physician that heals every grief.  
<BR><B>Diphilus</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Grief is a healthy emotion, and it's healthy to embrace it. By accepting loss, we clarify our values and the meaning of our lives.
<BR><B>Dean Koontz</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
There is no grief like the grief that does not speak.
<BR><B>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</B> 
<BR>
<BR> 
Only people who are capable of loving strongly can also suffer great sorrow, but this same necessity of loving serves to counteract their grief and heals them.
