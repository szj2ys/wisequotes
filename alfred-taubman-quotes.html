<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The idea of retailing is to get people inside the store.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>

<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>

<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I learned that my strengths were far more important than my shortcomings…

It just makes sense that if the fate of my family name and fortune are directly linked with the business I’m running, my effort and commitment – in most cases – will exceed those of a ‘hired hand.’  Call it passion.

<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Where [Milton] Petrie saw a tried-and-tested recipe for retailing success, I saw an inefficient use of space; were Petrie’s experienced store designers saw opportunity, I saw unnecessary barriers.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>

<BR>
Threshold resistance… The physical and psychological barriers that stand between your shoppers and your merchandise.  It’s the force that keeps your customer from opening your door and coming in over the threshold.  I think we can reduce all that with this new design.

<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>

<BR>
Every day, we encounter psychological, physical, cultural, social, and economic barriers.  In order to accomplish anything, people have to find a way to get beyond the limitations they believe that personal background, conventional wisdom, common practice, or experience has placed on their imaginations…
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>

<BR>
After Japan bombed Pearl Harbor… I couldn’t wait to enlist… It was around this time that I stopped used my first name, Adolph.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>

I learned the value of service and convenience, as well as presentation and delivery to pull the customer toward a new opportunity.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
