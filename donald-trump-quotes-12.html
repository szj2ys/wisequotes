<BR>
I’m absolutely convinced that it was the architecture itself that won us our approval.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My own mother was a housewife all her life.  And yet it’s turned out that I’ve hired a lot of women for top jobs, and they’ve been among my best people.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A lot of buildings can be successful, but I’m convinced that only one, at any given time, can achieve the blend of qualities necessary to attract the best buyers and command the top prices.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>

<BR>
We were selling fantasy.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The sort of wealthy people we were competing for don’t look for bargains in apartments.  They may want bargains in everything else, but when it comes to a home, they want the best, not the best buy.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The broker pushes a button on a computer and, presto, he’s got a huge commission.  As soon as the stock market falls out – which it will, because it too runs in cycles – most of these guys will be out on the street looking for work.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Why shouldn’t I have exactly the apartment I wanted – particularly when I built the whole building? 
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Hilton Hotels] How was it possible that the stock of a company that owned at least a hundred hotels worldwide could be hurt so badly by a strike against just two of them?
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The New York Stock Exchange happens to be the biggest casino in the world.  The only thing that makes it different from the average casino is that the players dress in blue pinstripe suits and carry leather briefcases.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Nick Ribis when he was thirty years old] The first thing I said to Nick was ‘Look, I’m not sure a lawyer as young as you are can handle a big project like this.’  Nick wasn’t thrown.  ‘To tell you the truth Mr. Trump,’ he said, ‘I’ve never had a client as young as you who could afford my bill.’

<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have a very simple rule when it comes to management: hire the best people from your competitors, pay them more than they were earning, and give them bonuses and incentives based on their performance.  That’s how you build a first-class operation.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>

Rent control is a disaster for all but the privileged minority who are protected by it.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>

Rent control is responsible for the desperate housing crisis that has plagued New York City for the past twenty years.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Convincing tenants to move wasn’t the kind of work I relished.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On zoning changes] ‘Do you mean,’ I said ‘that if I totally gut and rebuild the inside, and leave only the façade and the steel frame intact, that is okay?  But if I tear down the old building I have to replace it with a much smaller and less dramatic one?’  And he said, ‘Yes, Mr. Trump, that is correct.’

<BR>
‘Then why should we knock down an old building to build a new one that will be less than half the size, won’t look nearly as good as the old one, and will cost a lot more?’  ‘It’s simple, Mr. Trump,’ he said.  ‘The reason is that the windows in the Barbizon are much too small for a luxury residential building.’  The solution was obvious: leave the building intact, but cut out bigger openings and enlarge the windows.

I never had a master plan.  I just got fed up one day and decided to do something about it.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If there’s one thing I’ve learned from dealing with politicians over the years, it’s that the only thing guaranteed to force them into action is the press – or, more specifically, fear of the press.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Bullies may act tough, but they’re really closet cowards.  The only people bullies push around are the ones they know they can beat.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Confront a strong, competent person, and he’ll fight back harder than ever.  Confront a bully, and in most cases he’ll fold like a deck of cards.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was a perfect metaphor: the rink being trampled by one of the people who was being paid to fix it.

<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You won’t read the names of these people on the Forbes Four Hundred and they may not all speak perfect English, but I’ll guarantee you this: many of them have become immensely wealthy working for New York City.  They earn vast sums from huge, unwarranted cost overruns that city officials approve – and taxpayers underwrite.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People have been waiting for years to watch me fall, but I’m not about to help the cause.  Skating isn’t my strong suit.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In developing real estate… you can budget building costs, but you can’t truly project revenues, because you’re always at the mercy of the market.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve always loved tall buildings.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I remember coming in from Brooklyn as a kid with my father and pleading with him to take us to see the Empire State Building, which at the time was the world’s tallest building.  But then Chicago built the Sears Tower and took away the title.  I loved the challenge of bringing the world’s tallest building back to New York, where I felt it really belonged.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When you build any structure higher than about 50 stories, the construction costs escalate geometrically.  If maximum profit is your sole motive, you’re far better off putting up three 50-story towers than one 150-story skyscraper.  One the other hand, I felt the building would ultimately pay for itself as a tourist attraction and an overall lure.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve spent the first twenty years of my working life building, accumulating, and accomplishing things that many said could not be done.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Deals are my art form.  Others paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry.  I like making deals, preferably big deals.  That’s how I get my kicks.
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Spend whatever it takes to build the best.  Then let people know about it.  In New York, there is no limit to how much money people will spend for the very best, not second best, the very best.
