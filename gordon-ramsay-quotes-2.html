The two and a half years I had in France were the most important cooking years of my life.  The French have cooking at the forefront of their psyche and I was encouraged to feel the same.  I built some fantastic foundations for my future in those years.

Yes, it’s my Gordon Ramsay at Claridge’s restaurant.  It is generating a hurricane of acitivity.  Yesterday we received more than 500 telephone calls for reservations.  And 300 faxes.  The response has been phenomenal and, in only the second week, we have welcomed 1,500 clients.  The breathing, sweaty monster lives in the telephone.  Booking is open from 8am to 10pm – and there are four telephonists trying to secure the breach every time a fresh wave crashes through.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People think I struggle for staff because I’m an arsehole to work for.  But I guarantee my staff complete honesty which is important when you spend so many hours a day together.  I know my guys put their lives on hold for me, so I want it to be worth their while.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The waiters know that I charge them for breakages, for example.  I pay for the first breakage, but after that they have to pay and it is surprising how long it takes to break that second plate.  I pay for perfection, not accidents and mistakes.  
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>

<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you’re not here to enjoy it later in life, what’s the point?
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
That’s what seems hardest to get across to some… who think it might be glamorous and social to run a restaurant.  It isn’t.  It’s hard f*cking work day in and day out and I can’t believe how many people haven’t woken up to that yet.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

[On how tough things were going to be.] You will have to sweep the floor ten times an hour, peel a bucket of onions, cook for the staff. You will also scrub clean your own pans because this stops you from burning things.  You’ll be amazed how careful chefs are if they know they have to scrape the burned gunk off the bottom of their own saucepans.  I don’t give a damn about diplomacy or delicacy.  The more honest I am with you the better you will become.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>

<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>

[On what he wants carved on his gravestone.] I am not a television chef.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>
<BR>

[On his relationship with his wife.] We get on like a house on fire, always have, but I dread to think what the relationship would be like if I was there seven nights a week.
<BR><a href="gordon-ramsay-quotes.html">Gordon Ramsay<a/>

<BR>
<BR>
