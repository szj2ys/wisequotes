<BR>
<BR>
The gathering together of brainy executives I have always regarded as one of the most important parts of my job.  I have always kept my eyes wide open for sprouting talent.  For example, one youth caught my eye; I watched him as he developed into a lawyer; and then, when I figured he was ripe, I got him to become one of us.  You can’t afford to sit back and wait for talent to come to you.  You have to be constantly on the lookout for it and then go out and lasso it.

The main thing is to run your business absolutely straight.  When you have a good, clean bank, absolutely unentangled in any speculative exploits, nothing can happen to you.  Whenever banks fail, you find it is because of outside ventures or crookedness by someone inside the institution.  No man, no bank, no business, should put itself into the grip of any one else.  Failure usually comes from doing things that shouldn’t have been done – often things of questionable ethics.
<BR><a href="amadeo-peter-giannini-quotes.html">Amadeo Peter Giannini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Be ready to help people when they need it most.  Get ready to yank them out of a hole.  The glad hand is alright in sunshine, but it’s the helping hand on a dark day that folks remember to the end of time.
<BR><a href="amadeo-peter-giannini-quotes.html">Amadeo Peter Giannini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Some men come to grow away from the people who helped make ‘em.  When they climb higher, they forget the old friends and reach out for new ones who, they think, will give them something different they haven’t got.  The big fellow doesn’t give you a thing.  You’ll find a lot of the big guns will pay attention when they want something; they will use you when you get big enough for their purposes – and a lot of people fall for that stuff.  The fellows at the top of the ladder will leave you alone till you get there on top.  Then they will become interested only for what they can get out of you, not for what they can give you.  Some exceptions, yes.  Not many though.
<BR><a href="amadeo-peter-giannini-quotes.html">Amadeo Peter Giannini<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was easy to merge banks.  People don’t understand that as soon as you have bought a bank, you have assets and cash, and as soon as you take over, you get your money back.

[In 1945 on his seventy-fifth birthday on the fifth time he was going to retire] I’m ten years past the retirement age by our rules.  I’m quitting for good.  [‘It seems to me we’ve heard that before’ – A news reporter] And I meant it that time, too.
