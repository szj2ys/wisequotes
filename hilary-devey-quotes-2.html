[Advice to women.] Don’t be put off by working in a man’s world.  Yes it’s hard and yes you have something to prove but there isn’t a glass ceiling.  You can go as far and as fast as you want to go.  You just have to be tenacious and focused and very disciplined.

<BR>
<BR>
In some respects being successful has turned out to be a bit of a poisoned chalice.  You never really know if people are your friends because they like you, or they just like your money.
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you asked me now whether all the sacrifices were worth it, I’d say, ‘I don’t really know.’  Many times I’ve looked at my son and thought, ‘Why have I done this?’  In a lot of ways I was happier before I got rich.
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you are going to do it, be prepared to make a lot of sacrifices.
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>

<BR>
I’ve always lived my life at a phenomenal pace…
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>

<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My vision was that we’d be the number one in the sector.  And I was quite brave because part of my marketing strategy was then the number one pallet network.  And then I had quite a few competitors then try to emulate what I was trying to do.  
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Can you prove that we’re not the number one?  We said that we’d be number one, so now we will be number one.
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>

I wrote a business plan, I went off to see the bank manager who I think was a total misogynist [Man who hates women], patted me on the head and told me to go home and wash my pots and look after my child.  I walked away from that bank even more resolved.  And I thought, ‘Hilary, find a solution.’  
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>

It took me seven months to get Pall-Ex started…  And during that time… I drove approximately 2,000 miles every week visiting every postcode in this country.  
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I rented a flat above a fish and chips shop.  Of which the heat switched off when the fat fryer was switched off at night.  The windows - you would have half an inch of ice on in the morning.  So I tinfoiled all the windows at night before we went to bed.  And then I thought ‘Oh my god - my son looks cold as well.’  So I tinfoiled him as well.
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m actually a millionaire.
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I left school at 16, and eventually moved to London to work for a company that transported hanging garments.  I also met the father of my son, though we split up when he was three and a half.
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Peter Jones and Duncan Bannatyne] Duncan’s a fellow northerner, so I appreciate his no-nonsense approach.  And with Peter, I think he has a very dry sense of humour.
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m fun as well as being entrepreneurial.
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>

<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>

A man wouldn’t have driven in their pyjamas and coat in the middle of the night [to build their business], as I did.  
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People think that being a millionaire brings you freedom but that’s not true.  I have responsibilities, I just can’t pack and go – don’t you think I have a conscience?  I need to provide and take care of my people.  Next week I have a charity dinner to organise, then agreements to sign, always something.
<BR><a href="hilary-devey-quotes.html">Hilary Devey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
