<BR>
Anyone interested in money must study the stock exchange.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Keep them on their toes!
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Are you learning?  Are you getting stronger?  It’s all up to you.  You must now be strong and do something really worthwhile.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Public relations, that’s what you must concentrate on.  There’s nothing like a clever stunt to get something off the ground.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
First you have to have a good story to give.  Next you must know how to spread the gospel… my gospel.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Public relations is just blah-blah; but to be really useful the blah-blah has to be merchandised.  No use in publicizing a produce unless it sells.  A good free write-up is worth ten ads… but the secret of public relations is making friends with the press; knowing how to use them.  A really clever press release is one way.  It can save them a lot of work.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Here, I want you to have this.  Take it for luck.  It brought me luck and it will bring you luck too.  It is always better if you give people something you treasure.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Customers, particularly future customers, are not to be sneezed at.  Besides, a little sample won’t ruin us and I’ve made a friend; wait and see, she’ll spread the gospel.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Why blabber [about your successes]?  It only makes people envious and it brings beggars to the door.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No sooner do we bring out something new than Revlon copies us.  They are busy in there copying us… I swear.  They’re nothing but copy-cats.  I call it downright dishonest.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Written when she was past 90 years old] I have always felt a woman has the right to treat the subject of her age with ambiguity until, perhaps, she passes into the realm of over ninety.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>

<BR>

<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I felt my life was in my own hands.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My choice had been right – that this work I had chosen was infinitely preferable to any marriage which my aunt might have destined for me.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On going to London because it was] The world centre of thought, taste, money and beauty.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We lived out of our suitcases like actresses in a theatrical touring company.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On selling her business for $7.3 million in 1929 and being able to buy it back for $1.5 million] I knew that they would make a mess of it.  What do bankers know about the beauty business.

<BR>
<BR>
The idea wasn’t bad.  But the timing was all wrong.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On buying her business back for $1.5 million after having sold it previously in 1929 for $7.3 million] Ahead of me once more was the lonely treadmill of work.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I often don’t know if I am on my feet or my head.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I do actually nothing and work all the time.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have too much on my shoulders, I’m surrounded with people, but I can’t get to them… People… People… and I’m alone!  With burdens… such burdens!
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What do you really want to do with your life?  Let me tell you!
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1951] I noticed once again how those smart little French girls save their pennies to buy the best possible beauty aids on the market.  Though the soul of thrift they never take risks with their beauty by using cheap cosmetics.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being offered any business proposition or price] Too much.  [A former associate says ‘If somebody offered Rubinstein a package of gum for a nickel she would say ‘too much’ in the hope that it was the only package of gum in the world that could be bought for four cents.’]

<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1941] What I am really good at is promotion.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am very difficult to please.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Men could be a lot more beautiful.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Advice she gives to her salesgirls in 1941] You have to look right down into their pocketbooks and get that last nickel!
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[She felt she was] Confident and relaxed only in business.
<BR><a href="helena-rubinstein-quotes.html">Helena Rubinstein<a/>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
[On her first days in Australia] My new friends could not get over the milky texture of my skin.  It was, in fact, no better than the average girl’s in my home town in Poland, but to the ladies of Victoria, with their sun-scorched, wind-burned cheeks, its city-bred alabaster quality seemed remarkable.
