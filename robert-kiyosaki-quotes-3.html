Can you spot opportunities that may arise from these economic changes?<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The greatest fear in America today is running out of money during retirement.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Everyone has money problems.  If you want to make yourself rich, solve problems.  Identifying a problem creates the opportunity for creating a solution.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Those who haven’t learned from history are destined to repeat it.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Many also believe that to get higher returns means you have to take on more risk.  Nothing could be further from the truth.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Are you stubborn enough to be a winner?<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The difference between a saver and an investor, there is one word that separates them, and that word is leverage.  One definition of leverage is the ability to do more with less.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Most savers do not use financial leverage.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The government wants us to create jobs… not look for a job.  Our economy would collapse if everyone started looking for a job.  For our economy to grow, we need people to create jobs.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Use your mind to make money… and not to take excuses.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Excuses are a dime a dozen.  That’s why unsuccessful people have so many excuses.  If you cannot control your mind, you cannot control your life.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>I continue my financial education via real-life experience and by having great mentors as well as great advisors.  I love learning about money, business, finance and wealth.  I will probably be a student until the day I die.  I do not think I will ever feel I know enough, or that my cup is full or that I have all the answers.  I can always learn more and love doing so.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>It is the search for the answer – the answer I may never find – that makes me rich.  It is the search that keeps me going, getting richer and not retiring, even though I have the money to retire on.  You see it is not the quest for money that makes me rich.  It is the quest for knowledge.  It is the desire to learn more, do more, accomplish more and help those who want to learn that drives me… and money is just the score, a measure to tell me how we are doing.  Money is the celebration of success, just as the lack of money is the reminder that we need to learn more.  Just as a traveller watches for mile markers, I look at money simply as a marker – a market that measures the journey and distance travelled.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>People who invest to win are also very careful about whom they take financial education from.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>A true investor buys to own the investment and pass it on for generations.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Combat is not risky.  Being unprepared is risky.  I practice to reduce risk.  I improve my skills to reduce risk.  I study to reduce risk.  If I need to take a risk, I take a small one.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Most people invest money and do not invest much time.  Donald [Trump] and I invest a lot of time before we invest much money.  We prepare to invest.  I realised that entrepreneurship is not risky.  Being unprepared is risky.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Once my thoughts and attitude changed, my actions changed, and so did my result.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Be as wise as a serpent and as gentle as a dove.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>It is easier to be healthy if you are happy.  It is easier to be wealthy if you are happy.  And it is easier to be happy if you are in love with what you are doing.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>In my environment today money is not a dirty word.  Getting rich is fun, and investing is a game.  Rather than living below our means, we constantly work on expanding our means, increasing our income, building assets and serving as many people as we can.  Also we keep financially negative people out of our lives and surround ourselves with like-minded people who challenge and support us.  Our friends are also a part of our environment.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>To be a true entrepreneur, you need to be smart and love to learn.  If you do not love learning, chances are your business will not grow… because you are not growing.  Whenever I find a business that is declining or stagnant, it is often because the owner is declining or stagnant.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Focus, focus, focus.  All people who have achieved greatness have been very focused people.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>There is no correlation between a realestate agent licence and the business of real estate investing.  Most agents are not rich.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>I realised that most people were not rich simply because of fear.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>For many people, the fear of failing is more powerful than the joy of winning.  <BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>It is not the mistake that is the sin… it is not learning from mistakes that is the sin.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Your genius is found when you find a way to accomplish what you need to accomplish, in spite of what you lack.  Have the courage to find your way of getting things done.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>When you learn from the mistake you enter a whole new world of knowing and understanding.  If you deny, lay blame, justify, or fail to be responsible for your learning, the gates of new wisdom do not open to you.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Focus on teaching those you can, rather than those you can’t .  (You can’t teach a pig how to sing.)<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Teach those you can teach.  Be kind and treat with respect those you can’t.  Learn from those you can’t teach, how to become a better teacher, but never force someone who doesn’t want to learn to learn.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>To turn coal into a diamond requires heat and pressure.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Games are a reflection of behaviour.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>You cannot teach a poor person to be rich.  You can only teach a person who wants to learn to be rich to be rich.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Always remember that there are two kinds of pain… good pain and bad pain.  The reason most people are not rich is simply because they do not want to go through the good pain.  Many people are in bad financial pain simply because they avoid the good pain.  Eg.  1) Constant financial struggle 2) Living below one’s means and a low standard of living 3) Living above one’s means… keeping up with the Joneses 4) Chronically saying ‘I can’t afford it’ 5) Worrying about money 6) Always in debt… bad debt 7) Saving for tomorrow but not living today.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>There are many poor people with lots of money.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Most people spend their health to gain wealth.  Then they spend their wealth trying to get back their health.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>What intelligence really is 1) The ability to improve survivability 2) The ability to solve problems 3) The ability to learn something you do not want to do but need to do.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>One of the most important reasons for increasing your financial intelligence is to be able to solve bigger financial problems.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-6.html">6<a/> </p><p><BR>
