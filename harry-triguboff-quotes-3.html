[In 1949 when he was 14 years of age and left China to go to Australia] When I left I didn’t know if I would see my mother and father again because we were living in China.  China was a pretty volatile sort of place.  And I thought I should cry.  But I couldn’t cry.

[In 2010] I paid for an assembly hall and they called it in my father’s name.  So I came to the opening and I was asked to say a few words.  But instead of saying a few words, I started to weep.  Funny, you see, it’s a delayed reaction.  We can’t express ourselves always at the time we should.  Sometimes it takes time.

[On succession plan’s for the Meriton empire in 2010] The wife won’t do it, the daughters don’t want to do it.  In the next generation there are four of them.  I hope they will do it, yes.

[On tourism in Australian in 2010] The way we see housing today, it’s is not only for investors to buy, it is also for tourists to come and use.  Because when I look at the number of tourists that come to Australia, the numbers are very small compared with the rest of the world.  So I believe there is a very big future for tourism here.

I’m easy.  Very easy.  I’ll tell you why I am easy.  If someone is no good, I get rid of them.  It is no good being tough on somebody who can’t do the job.  If he can do the job then there is no point in being tough with him.

My idea is that I shouldn’t make it too hard for anyone.  If I make it too hard for someone, I am doing the wrong thing.  Because if it is hard for him, he can’t perform as well as he could if I was reasonable.

These days I don’t get angry much.  I found it good anyway because I get it out of my system, then I forget about it.  I forget about it in two minutes.  That’s the way I get rid of my steam.

The newspapers were against me.  They were telling me that the Australian dream was a home.  But that dream became worse and worse as they had to live further away from the city.  My dream became better as we could build higher and higher.

I only like to be involved where there are problems.  Where there are problems I come with an instant solution and it’s always wrong.  It doesn’t matter.  I get all the people around me and I make them all think at once with me and I promise you our solution is always the best.
