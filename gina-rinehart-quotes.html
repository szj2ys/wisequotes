<BR>
Beauty is an iron mine.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Beauty is ideas – the ideas of what we can do with the vast wilderness by mining it.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’d always thought that economics was about creating wealth and distributing it.  I came back home and Dad taught me far more than anything I learned at university.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
They are feeding the bureaucratic crocodile in the hope that it will eat them last.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I hated going down to boarding school.  I just thought my life in the bush was fantastic.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My father begun to teach me about the business when I was about 12 years old.   That’s when he first took me camping at the Kimberleys to actually see the iron ore country, appreciate its vastness, its importance, and to teach me about minerals.  He’s still teaching me.  The more I am with him, the more I learn.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1979] Whatever I do, whatever I do, the House of Hancock comes first.  Nothing will stand in the way of that.  Nothing.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We all know far too many stories where the third generation just destroys everything the first two have built up and I certainly hope my family are different, because I've worked too hard and my father has worked too hard for it to be given away.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was a wonderful childhood.  I never missed not having the things city children have.  I loved to ride and swim and I spent a lot of time with my father, whom I always got on very well with.  I sometimes went mustering with him – in fact I saw more of him than the average child sees of its father.  I wasn’t lonely.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m not ashamed of being a girl, and since I’m a girl I will do what a boy would have done had I been a boy.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I think if you scratch any West Australian you might end up finding a secessionist underneath.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To her son John after her father’s death] John, we are about to go into war – it is going to be tough and I don’t know how long it will last.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2012] I have genuinely looked after my family for their lifetimes, without leaving the mess and debts and liabilities I was left with… but what about Australia’s future?
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Norah of the Billabong] The author is strong on Australian values of that period, honesty, integrity, loyalty to family, kindness, work hard and do your work well, don’t be lazy.  This book, together with the Norah series of books, has not only influenced my like but I read it to my children also in the hope it would influence theirs.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her schooldays] Not exactly a trapped bird, but something like that.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the making of ‘Man of Iron’ by the BBC when she was 12] I had a ball making the film.  It meant a whole week off school – and back in the north-west.  But I suppose from that moment I began to be aware of my special background – and what lay ahead for me.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I like food, and will not diet.  If I get fat that will be the reason.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On University] A lot of the left-wing students at the uni didn’t take to me so kindly.  You feel jealousy, resentment.  Some people try to use you.  But I can cope.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her father Lang Hancock when she was twelve] He’s awfully good at sport, mainly table tennis… football and cricket.  He’s good at swimming… he’s not very good in the house, though.  He hates washing up and he’ll never do it.  He never makes his bed.  He always leaves it to us.  He’s awfully untidy.  He doesn’t like animals much; especially horses.  I think he’s quite handsome, just a bit fat.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At 21 years of age describing herself as the] Spitting image of my father in the way I think… And in major things we see eye to eye.  I agree with all his ideas for the development of the north west, our mining plans, and about Westralian secession politics.

<BR>
[In 1976] People in the eastern states just don’t realise that Perth is the loneliest capital in the world.  Nor do they realise that federalism, which was supposed to protect us, simply means that WA, which produces the mineral wealth, gets nothing for it; WA, which gets virtually no protection at all from the laughable federal defence forces, is simply paying exorbitant prices for over-protected eastern states manufacturers.  West Australians would live much cheaper and much better as a free-trade separate state, loyal to the crown.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think Canberra always needs to know if you don’t treat us right there’s WA people over here who’d love to secede.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had a father with immense vision.  For 30 years I regarded him as one of my best friends.  That friendship became strained but at the end of his life all he wanted to do was correct those problems.  He asked me to come back in 1991 and we resolved our differences.  He was strong and stubborn.  I am very proud of him…
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1976 on her father doing the deal with Rio Tinto]  It required being downright rude, telling them what schoolboys they were, by shocking them and shaming them, by telling them we were going to expose ‘em by saying they hadn’t got the guts to do the job they were paid to do.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On flicking through a glossy mining company brochure in 1976] Look at this.  The fools!  They are feeding the bureaucratic crocodile in the hope that it will eat them last.  I will fight my father’s fight but I wish the big mining companies would join us instead of trying to appease the government bureaucracies.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her tastes in 1976] I like Abba, but Dad won’t let me play them on the plane.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On an incident in the Pilbara when an MP was caught carving his initials on a tree] That, is not what it’s about.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A baby is a very private thing.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her first child] We didn’t want the publicity until we were sure everything was all right.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being back at work two weeks after giving birth to her first child] Goodness.  I’ve got to pick up two weeks work.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On children] I may have more, so that no single one of them has to bear the full burden of being heir or heiress…
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On education] I don’t want my children getting a conventional Australian education, learning the wrong things.  I’d sooner have them taught by governesses.  No, no I don’t want to cut them off from the community; I agree they’re going to have to deal with it eventually.  Perhaps I can send them to America to study under the right people, just as I wish now I’d had a chance to be taught by Milton Friedman, or Dr Teller…
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The only thing my father wants is to see Australia become a strong world power.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On meeting political leaders as a child with her father such as Margaret Thatcher or Lee Kuan Yew] I think Dad likes me to meet them because Dad and I can then talk things over afterwards, and pick up things from the discussions.  Of course the real question is not what they think of me, but what they think of Australia…
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On meeting overseas politicians with her father] I think what gets to them is the uniqueness of a father and daughter team at those topmost levels.  It takes them aback, makes them sit up and listen, and gives more impact to what we’re putting forward.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On whether Lang Hancock was either a visionary or a madman] I believe that Dad’s action have proved it was the former.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think my father is nearly perfect.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Frank Rinehart] The finest person I’ve ever known.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
For me it all started to happen when I was about 11 or 12.  I suddenly realised people were becoming aware of my father.
<BR><a href="gina-rinehart-quotes.html">Gina Rinehart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I thought I could stay out of it.  Then people turned their interest toward me and I found I was continually with adults, so I had to mature very quickly.
