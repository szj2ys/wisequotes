[In February 2014 on the book ‘The Intelligent Investor’ by <a href="benjamin-graham-quotes.html">Benjamin Graham<a/>] The Intelligent Investor, which I bought in 1949. My financial life changed with that purchase.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2014] I can’t remember what I paid for that first copy of The Intelligent Investor. Whatever the cost, it would underscore the truth of Ben’s adage: Price is what you pay, value is what you get. Of all the investments I ever made, buying Ben’s book was the best (except for my purchase of two marriage licenses).

<BR>
[In February 2014 at the age of 83.] I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2015.] My cigar-butt strategy worked very well while I was managing small sums.  Indeed, the many dozens of free puffs I obtained in the 1950s made that decade by far the best of my life for both relative and absolute investment performance… Most of my gains in those early years, though, came from investments in mediocre companies that traded at bargain prices. Ben Graham had taught me that technique, and it worked.  But a major weakness in this approach gradually became apparent: Cigar-butt investing was scalable only to a point. With large sums, it would never work well.

<BR>
[In February 2015 on Charlie Munger.] We sometimes don’t agree. In 56 years, however, we’ve never had an argument. When we differ, Charlie usually ends the conversation by saying: ‘Warren, think it over and you’ll agree with me because you’re smart and I’m right.’
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2015.] Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2015.] Too often CEOs seem blind to an elementary reality: The intrinsic value of the shares you give in an acquisition must not be greater than the intrinsic value of the business you receive.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2015.] Business models based on the serial issuances of overpriced shares - just like chain-letter models - most assuredly redistribute wealth, but in no way create it. 
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2015.] Berkshire shares should not be purchased with borrowed money. There have been three times since 1965 when our stock has fallen about 50% from its high point. Someday, something close to this kind of drop will happen again, and no one knows when. Berkshire will almost certainly be a satisfactory holding for Investors. But it could well be a disastrous choice for speculators employing leverage.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2015.] Cash… is to a business as oxygen is to an individual: never thought about when it is present, the only thing in mind when it is absent.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2015.] If you can’t predict what tomorrow will bring, you must be prepared for whatever it does.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2015.] Some truths can only be fully learned through experience.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2015.] A sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate premium can’t be obtained…   Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2015.] In the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: You see a cockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2015.] Volatility is far from synonymous with risk. 
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2015.] Borrowed money has no place in the investor’s tool kit: Anything can happen anytime in markets. And no advisor, economist, or TV commentator – and definitely not Charlie nor I - can tell you when chaos will occur.
