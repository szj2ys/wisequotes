[On his mother] She taught me that being poor was a state of mind, and I grew up thinking we were rich even though we didn’t have any money.  We were rich in what mattered.

My mother used to say that real estate was the most important thing you could own.

I bought my own clothes.  And a funny thing happened: the older I got, the more I started to strike out on my own, the more it became important to me to be respected in any room I entered.

My idea of rich was a million dollars.  I didn’t stop to think how I might make that much money, or what I’d do with it once I got it, but that was the figure I had in my head.  That was the time frame.  Being rich was having a million dollars.  Didn’t get more specific than that.

<BR><a href="daymond-john-quotes.html">Daymond John<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Donald Trump] He was a kid from Queens, just like me, so I had to see for myself what made this guy tick.
<BR><a href="daymond-john-quotes.html">Daymond John<a/>

I never believed in statistics.  Nothing was inevitable, far as I was concerned.  My circumstances might have had it in for me, but it was up to me to see that I didn’t head down the same wrong road as most everyone else in my neighborhood.  I wanted something better for myself, something more.
<BR><a href="daymond-john-quotes.html">Daymond John<a/>

I thought, well, if this kid wants my jacket, maybe someone else will want my sneakers, or my jeans.  Right away, I started thinking like a wholesaler.
<BR><a href="daymond-john-quotes.html">Daymond John<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s good to be from Queens.

I didn’t want to be a waiter for the rest of my life…
<BR><a href="daymond-john-quotes.html">Daymond John<a/>

I read a lot of books.  My favorite, ‘Think and Grow Rich’ [Napoleon Hill] I try to read at least once a year.  It taught me to write down my goals and to read them back every morning and every night.  It also taught me desire, which the author says is the key to everything else.
<BR><a href="daymond-john-quotes.html">Daymond John<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="daymond-john-quotes.html">Daymond John<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

The thing about branding is it isn’t etched in stone.  A brand is a mark or an image or a perception we stamp on a product, a concept or an ideal, but it doesn’t last forever.  Like anything else, it needs to be nurtured and reinforced, or it will start to fade.

<BR><a href="daymond-john-quotes.html">Daymond John<a/>
<BR>

Throughout my life, I have met the full gamut of billionaires, murderers, activists, icons, devils, angels, leaders, followers, priest and pimps.  They all had one thing in common – something they had, something they lost, or something they wanted.  And that something was power.
<BR><a href="daymond-john-quotes.html">Daymond John<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I only exist because of all the people who have laid the groundwork for me to walk in most doors and kick in some others…
