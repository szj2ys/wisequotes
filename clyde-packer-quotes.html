<BR>
[On being made in 1970 the joint managing director of Channel Nine in Sydney with his father (<a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>).]  It was a very equitable arrangement.  I had the responsibility and he had the authority.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On him once being asked about Kerry Packer’s ‘wrecking’ of the golden traditions of cricket with the World Series Cricket.] I am not my brother’s wicketkeeper!
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t want to get involved in corporate life, which is a combination of tedium and bullsh*t.  
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 1987 on his brother <a href="kerry-packer-quotes.html">Kerry Packer<a/> telephoning him to let him know his $1 billion plus deal to sell his electronic interests to Alan Bond.] I think he made a brilliant deal.  He got out at the top of the market.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There’s only a certain amount of wealth that makes a difference, after that, it’s all about ego and power.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We’re all expendable, all fallible, but tycoons believe they’re not – or maybe they worry that they are.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Being a tycoon is not a real thing.  
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On liking to wear a Kaftan (Caftan) [A man's long belted tunic, worn in countries of the Near East.] with respect to his figure.] Better than dieting.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 1956 at the age of 21.] No man can deny that French girls have something that other girls lack.  It is very hard to pin down what this is.  Perhaps it’s not what they have, but what they get away with in the way of make-up and exotic clothes.  Frenchmen always say that they prefer mature women.  They have an éclat, a poise, and an assurance that lift them streets above their younger colleagues, who are often more beautiful.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 1956 at the age of 21.] Mention ‘bikini’ to any of the 10 visiting French mannequins and you mention trouble.  Normally French girls wear bikinis, but not the mannequins.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 1956 on 10 visiting French mannequins.] They looked as quiet and demure as a Russian Trade Delegation when they stepped off the plane at Mascot airport in pouring rain.  They seemed so cool and smart in their heavy woollen suits you would have thought they had spent half the afternoon grooming themselves in their boudoirs instead of trying to sleep on a plane.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 1956 on 10 visiting French mannequins.] Whether their visit is a success or not, I know two people who will remember them.  One is me and the other is the poor harassed Customs official who had to unravel their pile of luggage into 13 separate heaps.  For 15 minutes pandemonium reigned in Her Majesty’s Customs office.  
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 1956 at the age of 21 on asking Marie Josephe Defaux on her opinion about Australian men.]  And Australian men in general?  ‘Australienne men zey are nice, it is evident.’, she said with a Gallic shrug of her heavily padded shoulders… Marie told me she had no intention of getting herself an Australian boy-friend.  ‘But if ze right one ‘appens along, then, alors, ‘e is lucky,’ she added.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 1971 on IMT and the decision to terminate it’s ‘Tonight’ shows.] Australian viewers were not unique in feeling they’d had a craw-full of concerts.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 1971 on IMT and the decision to terminate it’s ‘Tonight’ shows.] IMT has been one of the world’s most fantastic TV success stories.  The fact that it ran 15 years is an incredible achievement.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 1971 on whether IMT would have continued if Graham Kennedy had remained compere.] Graham’s exit was superbly timed.  He was smart enough to know when to get out.  The future will be creative and exciting.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1971 as deputy chairman and joint managing director of Television Corporation on the ABC.] With due respects to government television, people’s television, whichever you like to call it, I don’t think that if we had a government-owned system solely operating in this country that there would be three million sets in Australia today.  
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1971 as deputy chairman and joint managing director of Television Corporation on the ABC.] I believe there is an Australian character in commercial television.  I believe it’s getting stronger every year, and as well as getting stronger I’d like to see it getting a little better.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1971 as Managing Director of Channel 9.] Channel 9 very much regretted remarks used in the Dave Allen show on Saturday night.  The show was produced live to air, and it was impossible to edit offending material from the show.  I am surprised that Dave Allen as compere did not exercise more control throughout the programme, and particularly in the manner in which he conducted an interview with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.  I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to our viewers and express my sincere regrets on behalf of the station.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 1972 on a property deal buying as the joint managing director of Television Corporation Ltd the Craven’s Department store in Adelaide’s commercial centre for $600,000.00] It is a very long-term investment.  I would say that within three or four years there will be a glut of office space in Adelaide judging by the bulk buildings going up or approved.  If we did decide to redevelop the site as a new office block we might wait five or six years.

<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1972 as MLC (Lib) – member of parliament to NSW Minister for Labour and Industry Mr Hewitt to ensure that a Professor of philosophy at the Sydney of University was not.] Driven from his post by a small bunch of academic thugs.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 1973 on part of the reason why he publishes the ‘Forum Magazine’.  A magazine on sexual stories and fantasies.]  In order to give some background to the rationale behind FORUM, I would like firstly to briefly outline the enormous changes which have taken place since the beginning of this century in the role of sexuality in our society. There has been a gradual and very welcome (by most of us) change in our attitudes towards sexuality, our understanding of sexual needs and sexual behaviour, our knowledge about sexual physiology and sexual treatments. This has been described by Edward Brecher in The Sex Researchers (1970) as a 'gradual convalescence of our society from a debilitating sexual disease. This disease is commonly referred to as Victorianism, although epidemics of the same disease antedate Queen Victoria by centuries. The essence of the disease is the belief that sex is wicked, loathesome and likely to lead to disaster. Victims of the disease concede that some sex acts are licit - namely coitus from time to time between a man and his wife, during the first few decades of their marriage, if performed in the missionary ‘position’ in the dark, for the purpose of procreation.'
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 1973.] Television is a completely different ball game from newspapers.  It has a responsibility to present programs the public wants and not to ram its own viewpoint down their throat… If Channel Nine continues to take politically provocative actions there might be a public investigation into it.  What Nine is trying to do to Willesee, what they tried to do to [Bob] Hawke, and what they did to the New South Wales Labor Party builds up to a pattern.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 1974 on becoming a free spirit in control of his life.] I suspect my father was as glad to get rid of me as I was to get rid of him.  [Clyde had in earlier days wanted to go to University but his father had forbade it and said ‘You go to work for me.  You’ll learn far more in the school of hard knocks.’ – <a href="frank-packer-quotes.html">Frank Packer<a/>.]
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1984 on his brother being called ‘Goanna’ and associated allegations which Kerry Packer denied.] Had his rights trampled on and his name defamed.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1984.] I was sick of lugging this Packer persona around with me.  It was like going away for the weekend with three steamer trunks… I suppose it was privacy I was looking for.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1984.] When I came to America, Kerry said ‘I’d better buy your shares.’  I resigned as a director of Consolidated Press Holdings and there was a very amicable separation of interests.  The details have never been disclosed, and they are quite complex.  But I left Kerry totally in charge and I now have no shares in the company.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1984 on many expatriates becoming so by accident.]  They no longer leave Australia because they find it inadequate.  Their move is not thought out, often it’s experimental… or seen as the next stage in a career.  But then they just stay.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1984 on his book No Return Ticket only consisting of nine other Australians who who to live in America and not in England and Europe.]  I didn’t want to go over there and listen to all those Australian’s pretending to be English people.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1984.] In Australia I used to enter a pub very warily.  It’s hard to talk about it without sounding pretentious, but privacy was the issue for me.  
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1984.] You become enmeshed in the tycoon syndrome.  It’s self-destructive.  You lose yourself.  Your personality becomes smaller and smaller.  I think it’s a giant cover-up for inferiority.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1984 on his father being desperately shy and insecure.] He used to cover up with bluster.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1984 on his enterprises other than Magazine Investments which has Surfing Magazine as it’s flagship with a circulation of 110,000.] I have other investments in other areas, in venture capital and things.  I do as little as possible.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1984.] Kate [Packer] gets on with Americans better than I do.  It’s not that I don’t like them but I’ve reached a stage in life where I’m happy with the friends I’ve got and there’s no point in enlarging the circle.  People from home often drive up the California coast and look in.  In fact James Fairfax dropped in last week on his way to San Francisco.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1984.] It seems obvious that [Bob] Hawke is going to get back in.  I hope he makes ANZUS a stronger priority and comes down strong on New Zealand.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 1984.] My father thought universities were a waste of time.  He said: ‘You go to work for me.  You’ll learn far more in the school of hard knocks’… I tried to go to Sydney University but the old man made it too difficult.  I felt very awkward being the boss’s son.  I never really knew what to do.  There was a big strike but I could hardly join the picket line.  
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 1984.] The period of disillusionment hit me when I was about thirty-five… I’d had to suppress a large part of my personality.  I’d always been interested in human relationships but working for a father-tycoon this part of me was denied.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To Mike Willesee on him resigning.]  Congratulations on your integrity.  I’ve just completed my last official act as managing director.  I resign, too.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 1984 on the confrontation between Frank Packer and Mike Willesse and Frank Packer and Mike Willesee later making up.] That wasn’t the cause, it was only the trigger.  I don’t want to go into it.  Basically my father and I didn’t handle our relationship very well.  The main thing I objected to was that he couldn’t draw a distinction between work and family.  You were always on deck, night and day.  Probably I should never have gone to work for the business.
<BR><a href="clyde-packer-quotes.html">Clyde Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 1984.] The Packer name… followed you around wherever you went.  You couldn’t even go into a pub for a drink without copping it, so I left Australia.
