[In 2014.] Warren [Buffett] always sets the bar pretty high when we're looking at acquiring an asset.  Is this additive to the family of assets that Berkshire Hathaway Energy already owns?

[In August 1985.] I wish every boy of Boy Scout age could experience Scouting.  The experience and learning of Scouting is carried for the rest of your life.  
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 1985.] Boy Scouts of America is the most successful youth organization in our nation today and Boy Scout should be a household word, like it used to be.

<BR>
<BR>
[In March 1987 as Scoutmaster of Troop 58 Gadsen, Ala.] About five years ago a First Class Scout came to me before the troop meeting.  He wanted to quit Scouting, he said.  Football was taking a lot of his time, and he had other excuses as well.  I told him I didn’t respect a quitter and I wouldn’t let him hang it up.  He looked stunned, and asked why.  I told him I had a lot of confidence in him.  With his ability he could achieve just about anything he set out to do.  And he didn’t quit.  In 1985 he received his Eagle award.  That same year he also was student council president, played football, and was active in the church.  And recently I received a card that said, in part, ‘I could really tell you wanted me to succeed in whatever I did.  I still love you and Scouting… Tell Martha [Mrs Abel] I love her.’ - Patrick McGee.’

[In September 1998 as President of Northern Electric and on what he had done for the environment lately.] I believe our greatest contribution to the environment is the 5.8 million we have spent on energy efficiency in the past four years.

We have also provided grants for the heating controls for 230 mobile classrooms and heat-recovery systems for 200 dairy farms. I am pleased to say that these energy savings will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 187,245 tonnes.
