Conventional wisdom suggests that, for investors, more information these days is a blessing and more competition is a curse.  I’d say the opposite is true.  Coping with so much information runs the risk of distracting attention from the few variables that really matter.

<BR>
<BR>
An early Greek philosopher, Heraclitus, observed that a person cannot step twice in the same river, because the river changes constantly.  Nor, in the same sense, can an investor step twice in the same market, because the market changes constantly.

My kind of investing rests on three elements: character, goals, and experience.
<BR><a href="john-neff-quotes.html">John Neff<a/>

When better to write a book about out-of-favor investing than when it’s out of favor?

The investment process must begin somewhere.  In my case, all ladders start in the dusty rag and bone shop of the mart, where the supply of cheap stocks replenishes itself daily.

<BR>
<BR>
Long-term investment strategies need not rest on a few very risky glamour stocks.
<BR><a href="john-neff-quotes.html">John Neff<a/>

I was always a stubborn little fellow, which my mother expressed very succinctly: ‘John Brown,’ she declared, ‘You would argue with a signpost.’  She was not only right, she was prescient.  My whole career, I have argued with the stock market.  Happily, as the Windsor Fund’s record shows, I won more arguments with the market than I lost.

It is irrational and unsentimental.  It is cantankerous and hostile.  At times, it is forgiving and congenial.  
<BR><a href="john-neff-quotes.html">John Neff<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The market has good days and bad days, good years and bad years.  You can’t predict them, and they can reverse course with stunning speed.  But you can learn to cope with them and improve your odds.
