<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>

My dad… wanted his children to get fully educated.  He was fighting for ‘em and everything.  He was a good dad.  
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>

<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father being very careful spending money] The funny thing is, I didn’t inherit any of that thrift.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father asking ‘Walter, what can it be used for?’ on him building his state-of-the-art studio in Burbank in 1939 and showing him the construction site] I couldn’t quite grasp what he was after and suddenly it dawned on me.  He meant if we failed how could we liquidate… how could we get our money back out of it, see?  So I was, ‘Now this would make a perfect hospital.’… I went through the whole darn studio and explained the thing to him as a hospital.  He was happy.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On father when his mother died in 1938 in an accident] He was just lost without her.  It was the darnedest thing.  After she died, I never felt so sorry for anybody in my life as I did my dad… It was a very sad thing.

<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Main Street represents the typical small town in the early 1900s – the heartline of America.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We had every brick and shingle and gas lamp made five-eights true size.  This cost more, but made the street a toy, and the imagination can play more freely with a toy.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>

[On the public in 1931] We have found out that they want most to laugh.  We learned after hard lessons, too, that the public wants its heroes.  Most of all we learned that the American public loves dance music.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>

[In 1931] It is not our job to teach, implant morals, or improve anything except our pictures.  If Mickey [Mouse] has a bit of practical philosophy to offer the younger generation, it is to keep on trying.  That’s what we do who make animated cartoons.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>

[On working late into the night while his wife Lillian feel asleep on the davenport in his office] Suddenly I’d look at my watch and it’d be 1:30.  I’d look at her, she’d be sound asleep, and I’d keep working till I finished.  So I’d go in and wake her up and she’d say ‘What time is it?’ and I’d say 10:30, and we’d go home and she’d go to bed and never know.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the industry in the early days] Everybody had ambition; everybody wanted to be a producer.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>

I’m going to go independent.  I’m going to own [my films].  And I stuck to it.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On never being at the mercy of a [film] distributor again] You can lick them with ‘product’.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I used to be less tolerant in those days because there was more pressure of that payroll and getting that picture out… I guess I was a pretty tough guy at times…

I was the salesman.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To Ub Iwerks in 1928] Show some of your old SPEED.  Work like hell BOY.  It is our one BIG CHANCE to make a real killing.  Forget a lot of the fancy curves and pretty looking drawings and devote your time to the ACTION.  You can do it – I know you can… GIVE HER HELL… Don’t tell me it can’t be done.  It has got to be done… So quit acting nervous and fidgety.  Forget everything… [and] get that DAMN picture back here in time.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Ub Iwerk leaving] I just can’t feel that he would do a thing like that.  This boy has been loyal to us.  
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Ub Iwerks] You couldn’t go out and ever hope to hire a man who was as well schooled in optics as Ub; he’s a genius.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People often ask me if I know the secret of success and if I could tell others how to make their dreams come true.  My answer is, you do it by working…The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>

[On Adolf Hitler] Mr A. Hitler, the Nazi old thing, says that Mickey’s silly.  Imagine that!
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>

[In 1928] None of our profits [are] going to some leech sitting at a big mahogany desk telling us what to do.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
They are all a bunch of schemers and just full of tricks that would fool a greenhorn… [I feel] like a sheep amongst a pack of wolves.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The public likes little fellows in comedy.  Everyone picks on them and sympathy is aroused.  So when they finally triumph over the bigger characters, the public rejoices with them.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m not interested in money, except for what I can do with it to advance my work.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
 [On the popularity of The Three Little Pigs ] I don’t know.  You’ve got me.  I’d like to find out myself just why people liked them.  Then I’d know better how to do it again.  We’re just feeling our way here.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What was our original purpose?  Why, to make people laugh.  To make good comedies.  To entertain.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s not just a cartoon.  We have new worlds to conquer here.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The first duty of the cartoon is not to picture or duplicate a real action or things as they actually happen, but to give a caricature of life and action… The point must be made clear to the men that our study of the actual is not so that we may be able to accomplish the actual, but so that we may have a basis upon which to go into the fantastic, the unreal, the imaginative – and yet to let it have a foundation of fact, in order that it may more richly possess sincerity and contact with the public… I definitely feel that we cannot do the fantastic things based on the real unless we first know the real.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>

We cannot do the fantastic things based on the real unless we first know the real.

<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Once you’ve lived through the worst, you’re never quite as vulnerable afterwards.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Work is the real adventure in life.  Money is merely a means to make more work possible.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think that everything that ever happened to me was a good turn.  
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
