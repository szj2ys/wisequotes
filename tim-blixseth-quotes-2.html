It’s not really my debt if it’s non-recourse…
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If was fun back in the go-go years, to have all the stuff you don’t need and always wanted.  Anyone who says they didn’t have fun isn’t telling the truth.  The whole world was living like that.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
No one really owns wealth.  It doesn’t mean anything by itself.  It’s just a tool, something we use for a while, and then it’s someone else’s.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Would I be just as happy with no money?  Absolutely.  But I have to be very frank.  Once you’ve had it, it’s good to look back and know you don’t have to make it again.  Had I been a guy working in a lumber mill in Roseburg, Oregon, I might have been like my father [A minister whose family was on welfare], looking across the fence and seeing what I might have done and could have done.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I love things perfect…I think if you demand excellence in life.   If you run your life like that, if you run your business like that… it’ll be better.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The burning determination not to be a ‘welfare kid’.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think my first commercial buy and sell was when I bought three donkey’s for twenty-five dollars and took them home, repackaged them and called them pack mules.  Put an ad in the paper for seventy-five dollars each and they sold like the first phone call.  So it was a matter of rebranding and repackaging what was a donkey to a pack mule and tripling the price.      
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I really got into music – that was my escape.  So I went to Hollywood, pretty young – 18 or so and tried my hand at song writing and actually got a record deal.     
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
About my mid-twenties I was called a millionaire, self-made.  It was probably not a very good thing for me.  Because like probably anyone else in the mid-twenties I was pretty cocky.  And I thought I was bullet-proof, I can’t fail, everything I do is Midas.  And I found out a little bit later I was wrong and I wasn’t quite as smart as I thought I was…
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s like the most devastating feeling when you have come from welfare with nothing, and then you have a little airplane and a helicopter and you have money, and then you don’t have that anymore.   It’s like ‘Did I dream that? Am I always going to be on welfare?’  So that was probably the best business lesson.

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1990 I’d decided that I’d had enough, and so I sold my half interest in the company.  And I thought I’ve got enough to live on the rest of my life.  I thought then and so I actually took a year and called it ‘Retirement’ if you will.  
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We were trying to create a family environment where families that had made success in their lives, or even perhaps inherited money, where they could go and recreate as a family, and we found that we had the parents say ‘We’ve never had more fun with our kids than coming here.  So, we knew pretty much right off the get go that the family concept was the right concept for the Yellowstone Club.  
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We going to sell a hundred and fifty world memberships which they don’t require property ownership…. Three million dollars for a refundable membership, which means if you get tired of it, you can get your money back.                
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ll always say, if I ever said I have to get rid of anything, the last thing will be the plane.  It’s been eight years since I’ve taken a commercial flight.  Except I took one last year from Paris to Istanbul, because I had no choice.  But I think that everyone should be required to take one commercial flight a year if they own a private jet just to keep the humility and the appreciation for what they have.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t really have any guilty pleasures, because the success I’ve been able to have over the years has been kind of gradual.  You have one boat that is this big and then a little bit bigger and pretty soon you don’t realize you have a great big one.  So, I don’t look at any of these things as extravagant, it’s just what I’m able to have and I’m so thankful for them, but I’m don’t think that it’s a guilty pleasure.

I grew up on welfare in a tiny town called Roseburg, Oregon.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We were so poor that I had to hunt deer and elk to put meat on my family’s table, and endured the taunts of my classmates when I lined up for free lunches in the school cafeteria.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As a boy I ate more government-provided Spam than I care to remember!
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am truly a blessed man.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The lessons I learned as that poor boy in Roseburg have stayed with me my entire life…

[In 2006 on searching for properties for Yellowstone Club World] It’s like Easter egg hunting.

I’m not very good at vacation.  About four days, and I’m ready to go.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] To me, what I do is a vacation.  Every day.  Fly on a private plane.  Land in California.  End up in Southern Mexico for dinner… I’ve got to go to St. Andrews and play golf with customers for a week.  That’s a vacation.  Or I gotta go on to Mexico for a week and hang out on the boat and host some people.  That’s a vacation.

You didn’t have to be the in-between guy.  You could just own it.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Nothing increases values like ownership.

The Yellowstone Club, is turning donkeys into pack mules.

[On Heart of America in 2006] It always really bothered me that I never had a hit.  They can’t say that anymore.

There’s one member in my religion, that’s me.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>

[On church when he was young] I thought it was absolutely a farce.  They believed they were the only 67 people on the whole planet Earth that were going to be able to go to heaven.  It wasn’t right.  It didn’t make sense.  To think that 67 people out of how many at the time – three billion? – were the only ones who’d get to go to heaven: it was ridiculous.

There’s this huge appetite for families to spend quality time together and it’s not happening in their primary residences.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t even actually watch that much TV.  
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On entering the Forbes 400 rich list in 2005] I never even think about these things.  Wealth you can count.  Some people have a great big pile and some people have a small pile.  But we all have zero when we die.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his Forbes 400 listing in 2005] I’m just glad it doesn’t say ‘inherited’ next to it.

[In 1992 on battles with environmentalists] Maybe someplace in this United States of America, somebody needs to draw a line and protect private property rights.  Maybe I’m the guy and that’s the place.
<BR><a href="tim-blixseth-quotes.html">Tim Blixseth<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On parking a metaphoric bulldozer at the entrance to a place near and dear to environmentalists] Metaphoric or not… The best way to get a deal done is to keep everybody’s attention on the deal… Everybody paid attention.
