I am worried about the low educational levels seen in Brazil – we are losing the competency race in the globalized world.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Sam Walton] I was with Sam once.  We were in a competitor’s store.  I had a bad cold, and in the store I saw a flask of Vicks Vapor Rub.  I was there, I saw it and so I bought it.  It cost twenty-five cents or something like that.  I paid at the counter and Sam was absolutely furious.  He went berserk.  He made me go back and get a refund.  Then we immediately went to a Wal-Mart store where he showed me that the same product cost one cent less.  He could not understand why I would buy something in a competitor’s store that cost one cent more.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Sam] Walton believed it was his duty to provide the lowest prices to his consumers.  That was a core principle.  And he stuck to his principles – consistently.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[People with consistency] are very much to the point.  They are very confident about saying what they believe.  There’s not much b.s.  They’re courageous.  It saves a lot of time and is good practice.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Many of my colleagues, since they were dealing with the state in some form or another, got into the practice of being corrupt because it was a fast way to get rich.  Some of them did reasonably well for a while, but they eventually forgot how to run a business properly.  They thought the whole world was dependent upon buying somebody or paying someone off.  One by one they gradually disappeared.  And the guys who were trying to run their businesses on an ethical basis, they lasted much longer.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Ethics are different around the world.  But, one thing that remains constant: A person with integrity has the utmost respect for his or her teammates.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
No matter where you are in the world, you treat other people exactly how you would like to be treated – honestly and fairly.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve dealt with a lot of different people… Europeans, Brazilians… different religions, different backgrounds.  I really don’t care.  I think the one trait that you really can’t deal with is a lack of integrity.  If a person is playing games, even if they are useful to the firm in some ways, in the end they get mixed up; they don’t function within the whole organization.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If a person is bad tempered, nervous, I don’t care.  As long as he has integrity you can deal with him, with any problem.  The whole organization will function much better if people have integrity overall.  Good and ethical people attract more good and ethical people.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A great deal is one that is long-lasting and sustaining.  Many deals can be very good for the short term but have little long-term perspective.  Instead of being a quick fix, our recent combination of AmBev and Interbrew to create InBev has an agreement of twenty years between the shareholders.  
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My biggest success in business was the discovery some forty years ago that by attracting excellent people to work with me and giving them a chance to grow, I would go much further than I would by myself.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Before he destroyed Donald in playing tennis] Donald [Dell], we must play some tennis.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To Donald Dell after beating him in tennis] Now we’re even.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To Donald Dell] You beat me in the first round at Wimbledon thirty years ago, and I’ve been waiting to get my revenge ever since!
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To Donald Dell – Before eventually making Try Sports and the National Tennis Center of Brazil] Donald, we really need to do something together here in Brazil – some tennis events, some marketing, some television.  
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his decision to put the tennis shoes in the background because] So much by playing, I realized that hardly would I be among the ten best in the world.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If someone is doing well, better not spend too much time looking for how to do it. Go ahead, look and fit it your way, and ready
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Buy low and sell high.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is an intimate relationship between the force applied and the results obtained.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If possible, in this endeavor capture the winds and let them help you.

<BR>
Everything is a learning experience, we're always learning and trying to improve, even today, at 67, I still try to serve better on the tennis court.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>

Give up just on the very last point.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>

Focus on your goal, always have a big dream.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Do not play to the audience, a beautiful game does not always win.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Always be on the prowl, life, business and exceptional tennis depend on opportunities when they arise - learn to recognize them and go get them.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>

Being ethical and transparent always pays off.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is good to dream big and reach there (at age 9, I wanted to be world champion in tennis, at just 45 years old, I came to the category of veterans, but I found myself satisfied).
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2005] My current goal is to become the largest brewer in the world.  I already have an idea for the next step.  
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010] Unlike the Americans, who only have eyes for technology segments, Brazilian businessmen go abroad to invest in sectors considered ancient, like beer, cement, steel and even hamburgers.
<BR><a href="jorge-paulo-lemann-quotes.html">Jorge Paulo Lemann<a/>

Entrepreneurs and Brazilian executives were tested in an environment of economic turmoil and great change.  With this, we are more prepared to deal with adverse situations.

In the case of Brahma, if we had done the due diligence properly, we would never have bought.  Immediately after the acquisition, we found major financial problems, especially in the pension fund.  But we did buy.  Why?  Because our feeling said that we are a country with a young population, with much fire, and we believed that beer was being poorly played a good deal here.  [Ten years this they acquired their rival Antarctica, creating AmBev]
