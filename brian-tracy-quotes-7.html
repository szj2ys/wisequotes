<BR>
<BR>
Always give people the choice of “A” or “B” rather than “Yes” or “No.”
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Keep your sales pipeline full by prospecting continually.  Always have more people to see than you have time to see them.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Always be willing to go the extra mile, to do more than is expected of you.  There are never any traffic jams on the extra mile.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Focus your sales conversation on the benefits that the customer will enjoy when he or she owns and uses your product or service.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Ask someone to accompany you on your sales calls, sit there quietly, and then tell you afterwards what they saw.  Ask for feedback; you can only improve with the frank and honest evaluations of others.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Look upon your sales territory as a farmer looks upon a rich piece of land; like an area to be harvested, year after year.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Unlock your inborn creativity; always be looking for better, faster, easier ways to sell more of your product or service.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Prepare your questions thoroughly in advance; they are the keys to sales success.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Avoid negative people at all costs; they tire you out and wear you down.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Dedicate yourself to serving your customers and your sales will take care of themselves.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Determine the real reasons that people buy your product or service and organize your entire sales presentation around them.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Recognize the words, “I’m not interested,” for what they are.  The customer is saying that his or her interest has not yet been aroused sufficiently.  That’s all.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Listen for emotion-charged words that the customer uses; repeat them back later to show you were really listening.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Ask questions and listen until you discover the “hot button” of your customer; then structure your presentation around your client’s concern.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Demonstrate that your product or service is the ideal solution to your client’s problem.  The sale follows from that.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Make a list of all the reasons why anyone would buy your product or service.  Organize them by priority and memorize them.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Go to bed early each night; selling is hard work.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t use words like, “Quality,” “Service,” “Value,” or “Price” as reasons to buy unless your competitors do not offer them at all.  Otherwise, you’ll just sound foolish.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Identify the attributes of an excellent prospect and then seek out more of them.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Help your customer recognize that he has an immediate need for what you are selling.  This comes first.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
Differentiate your product or service from your competitors’ by emphasizing your “unique selling proposition.”  Bring the entire decision to hang on this key benefit.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Appeal to the most pressing need of your customer as it relates to your product in every selling situation.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t ever settle for less than your best; your potential is unlimited.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Give customers honest information about how your product or service can help them to improve their businesses or lives.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Determine the key result areas of your prospect; how can you help him or her to perform better in one of these areas?
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Think about your easiest sales; why did they take place, and how could you create more of them?
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Commit to being among the top 10 percent of people in your profession.  Anything less is not worthy of you.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Dress the way your prospect’s advisors dress; if you want people to accept your recommendations, you must look believable.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Pay twice as much for your clothes, and buy half as many.  Expensive clothes are cheaper because you wear them more often.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Never wear or carry anything that looks cheap when you go to see a customer.  It undermines your credibility.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Become an unshakable optimist; talk about and think about only the things you want.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Exercise regularly; the fitter you are, the more effective you will be.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Manage and influence the customer’s perceptions of you by managing and influencing what you allow him or her to see and hear.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Start by sitting up straight, be alert and lean forward when you are talking to a customer.  This makes you look professional.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Make a game of finding something positive in every situation.  Ninety-five percent of your emotions are determined by how you interpret events to yourself.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Optimism is the one quality more associated with success and happiness than any other.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Dream big dreams!  Imagine that you have no limitations and then decide what’s right before you decide what’s possible.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Attitude and personality are as important as experience and ability.  Choose wisely.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Your attitude is an expression of your values, beliefs and expectations.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you did not care at all what anyone else thought about you, what would you do differently or change in your life?
