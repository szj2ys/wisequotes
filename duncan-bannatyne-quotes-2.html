[As a high school student] Wherever I went, I felt like a misfit.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I noticed that most of the kids at the high school had bikes and, as the only kid without one, I felt incredibly left out.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On building his own paper delivery route by cold calling on 150 houses to get 100 names as a young high school student] I guess I learned early that business and opportunity aren’t handed to you on a plate and that you have to make your own chances.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There are only three ways of getting out of a contract with the armed services: you can either die, get so badly injured that you can’t perform your duties, or misbehave so badly that they throw you out.  Guess which one I preferred?
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
At the age of 30, I was a penniless beach bum.  At the age of 37, I was a millionaire.  I honestly believe that anyone – absolutely anyone – can do exactly what I did and turn their life around; you just need to wake up to the possibilities that are all around you and make a decision to change your life.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I left school at 15 without any qualifications.  At 19, I was dishonourably discharged from the Royal Navy.  For the next ten years I made ends meet with a series of dead-end jobs… until I found myself sitting on a beach one day wondering where I was headed.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had just read a piece in a newspaper about a guy who had started a business from scratch and had made his first million.  His name was Alan Sugar.  As I sat on that beach, I decided that this was my wake-up call.  I was going to do exactly what this Alan Sugar had done: I was going to change my life and make myself a million.

<BR>
For all those people who don’t fit into Human Resources pigeon holes – too young, too old, not enough experience, over-qualified, criminal record – working for yourself is the most enjoyable and lucrative option if you want a meaningful career.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
For everyone who finds themselves in jobs where they spend most of their day watching the clock in return for a modest way, then becoming an entrepreneur means an end to low pay, and low esteem.  It might also make you very rich.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most successful entrepreneurs start a series of businesses before they start the one that makes them wealthy.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is possible to get rich in a very short space of time, but it’s usually a fluke and not something you can properly teach.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I got the impression that entrepreneurs were seen as troublemakers by the establishment.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Entrepreneurs come in all shapes and sizes.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve found that most entrepreneurs fall into one of two camps: those who build up a business and can’t imagine ever doing anything else because they love it so much, and those who ambition is to create so much value in a business that they can then either pay someone else to run it for them or sell it for a lot of money.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can only really learn about business by being in business.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I started in business, I didn’t have any money, any useful contacts or a track record.  All I did was work hard to stockpile a bit of cash, look around for opportunities and reach for the Yellow Pages when I needed a phone number…
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I started my first business with 450 pounds, and when I sold it for 28,000 pounds a few years later I had already started on my next one.  I sold my second business for 46 million pounds.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you really want to start a business, you’ll find the time.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is a myth that starting a business costs a lot of money.  Some businesses do, but most entrepreneurs I know invested less than 10,000 pounds in their first venture…
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you can start your first business on a shoestring, you build up credibility with banks and investors for your next venture.

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
Starting a business is such a massive commitment that it’s very difficult to do it without the support of those closest to you.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You very rarely go from starting your first business to becoming incredibly wealthy in just a few years.  Most entrepreneurs started a series of businesses – some of which will have flopped – before they started the one that made them a fortune.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You’ll learn what you need to learn as you go along.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There are thousands upon thousands of ideas out there waiting to be turned into businesses, and once you start looking for opportunities, they are not hard to find.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve never had an original idea for a business in my life.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Ideas for new businesses broadly fall into three categories – those that solve a problem, those that copy another business and those spawned from genuine innovation.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There’s absolutely no doubt that starting a business is a risk, but it is a calculated risk, and your sensitivity analysis is what lets you calculate the size of that risk.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
At it’s best, selling makes everyone’s lives better because people find out about products and services that they want or need.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Targeting your sales to the right people can save you an awful lot of time.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The secret to data management is ‘little and often.’
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We are all just a few phone calls away from anyone we need to help our business…
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is often the people we know less well who turn out to be the most useful.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most people like to help.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You don’t have to move to get the money out of your property.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you’re going to look for investment in your business, then the first thing you need to understand is the risk-reward ratio.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
After 30 years in business, I can promise you that practically everything to do with running a business comes down to just one thing – common sense.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Take responsibility for the small stuff, and the big stuff will come much more easily.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Brands aren’t static: if your business changes, your brand and logo may need to change too.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
How do you make your potential customers’ lives easier or better?  If you can come up with a good answer, then you’re heading in the right direction.
<BR><a href="duncan-bannatyne-quotes.html">Duncan Bannatyne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If all your company’s talent, contacts and drive come from the same person, the business becomes worthless if that person decides to leave.
