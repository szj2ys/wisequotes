<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The biggest, the single biggest advantage a value investor has is not IQ.  It’s patience and waiting.  Waiting for the right pitch and waiting many years for the right pitch.

If you went to a horse race track and you were offered 90 percent odds of a 20 times return and a 10 percent chance of losing your money, would you take that bet?  Heck Yes!  You’d make that bet all day long, and it would make sense to bet a very large portion of your net worth with those spectacular odds.  This is not a risk-free bet, but it is a very low-risk, high-return bet.  Heads, I win; tails, I don’t lose much!
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On a successful motel investing strategy.] The formula is simple: fixate on keeping costs as low as possible, charge lower rates than all competitors, drive up the occupancy, and maximize the free cash flow.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Pabrai Funds and potential investors.] I don’t need to do too much due diligence on my investors because I’m getting their money and not vice-versa.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>

<BR>
His story is all about ‘Few Bets, Big Bets, Infrequent Bets.’  And it’s all about only participating in coin tosses where ‘Heads, I win; tails, I don’t lose much!’
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My take on Virgin Atlantic is simply this: if you can start a business that requires a $200 million 747 jumbo jet and a boatload of employees in a tightly regulated industry for virtually no capital, then virtually any business that you want to start can be gotten off the ground with minimal capital.  All you need to do is replace capital with creative thinking and solutions.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We begin by eliminating all businesses that are either not simple businesses or fall squarely outside our circle of competence.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Capitalism is greed driven… Capitalists strive hard to capitalize on any opportunity to make outsize profits.  The irony is that, in that pursuit, they usually destroy all outsized profits.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The Buffett Partnership has never had a down year, in spite of placing large Kelly-type bets.  As far as I know, neither has [Joel] Greenblatt or [Edward] Lampert.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Anytime we are trying to compute odds for the way the future of a given business is likely to unfold, it is, at best, an approximation.  We try to adjust for this by ascribing conservative odds.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Investing is just like gambling.  It’s all about odds.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Looking out for mispriced betting opportunities and betting heavily when the odds are overwhelmingly in your favor is the ticket to wealth.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Arbitrage is a powerful construct and a fundamental tool in the arsenal of any value investor.  With arbitrage, we get decent returns with virtually no risk.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Sniffing out an available arbitrage opportunity is what prompts entrepreneurs to embark on journeys that have lead to the creation of compelling businesses.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When Leo Goodwin started GEICO, he probably never thought of it as being an arbitrage-type play.  Yet, that’s exactly what GEICO was, and still is, all about.  He saw no one was selling auto insurance direct.  He thought it make all the sense in the world and started his journey.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most of the top-ranked business schools around the world do not understand the fundamentals of margin of safety…
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most of the time, assets trade hands at or above their intrinsic value.  The key, however, is to wait patiently for that super-fast pitch down the center.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is during the times of extreme distress and pessimism that rationality goes out the window and prices of certain assets go well below their underlying intrinsic value.  Extreme distress can be caused by macro-events like 9/11 or the Cuban missile crisis.  Or they can be company specific…
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We cannot predict which asset classes are likely o get distressed next.  However, if we only focus on a single asset class of stocks, that encompasses thousands of businesses.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Wall Street could not distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and it got confused between the two.  Savvy investors like [Warren] Buffett and [Benjamin] Graham have been taking advantage of Mr. Market’s handicap for decades with spectacular results.
<BR><a href="mohnish-pabrai-quotes.html">Mohnish Pabrai<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
For me, any sort of tech investment is a very fast five-second pass as they tend to be unpredictable, rapidly changing businesses.
