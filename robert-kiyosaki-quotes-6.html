Investing is fun.  Investing can make you very very rich.  More importantly investing can set you free, free from the struggle of earning a living and worrying about money.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The reality is that real investors do not park their money.  They move their money.  It is a strategy known as the ‘velocity of money’.  A true investor’s money is always moving, acquiring new assets, and then moving on to acquire even more assets.  Only amateurs park their money.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>As long as you have more cash flowing in than flowing out, your investment is a good investment.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>If you are a true investor, it does not matter if the markets are going up or going down.  A true investor does well in any market condition.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>In many ways, learning from my mistakes and taking responsibility for my mistakes was the best education I could have asked for.  If I had not learned from my mistakes I would not be where I am today.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>True capitalists are generous because a B [Business] quadrant capitalist knows you must give more to receive more.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The moment a person know how to make money out of nothing or with other people’s money or a bank’s money, they enter a different world.  It’s a world almost an exactly opposite the world of those in the E [Employee] and S [Self-employed] quadrants where they experience hard work, high taxes, and low returns on investment.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>When do you need a coach?  When I know I need to be pushed, held accountable, challenged to go beyond my resistance, my laziness, my limitations, I hire a coach – if what I want is important to me.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>If you are a strong leader, you can hire people smarter and better trained than you are.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Success requires discipline.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Give more to receive more.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Learn more so you can do more.  Focus on doing more with less, and enriching the lives of others.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Money alone does not solve your money problems,.  That is why giving poor people money does not solve their money problems.  In many cases, it only prolongs the problem and creates more poor people.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Money problems make you smarter… if you solve your money problems, your financial intelligence grows.  When your financial intelligence grows, you become richer.  If you do not solve your money problem, you become poorer.  If you do not solve your money problem, that problem often grows into more problems.  If you want to increase your financial intelligence you need to be a problem solver.  If you don’t solve your money problems you will never be rich.  In fact, you will become poorer the longer the problem persists.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The rich get richer because they learn to solve financial problems.  The rich see financial problems as opportunities to learn to grow, to become smarter and to become richer.  The rich know that the higher their financial IQ, the bigger the problem they, can handle, hence the more money they make.  Instead of running, avoiding, or pretending money problems do not exist, the rich welcome financial problems because they know that problems are opportunities to become smarter.  That is why they get richer.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>When the rich have money problems, they use their financial integrity… to solve those problems.  If the rich don’t know the answer to their money problems, they don’t walk away and throw in the towel.  They seek out experts who can help them solve their problems.  In the process, they become financially more intelligent and are that much more equipped to solve the next problem when it comes around.  The rich don’t quit.  They learn.  And by learning they grow richer.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Business, investing and making money is my game.  I love my game.  I am passionate about the game.  So if I retired, I would lose my passion and what is life without passion?<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Solving the problem was the path to wealth.  You can quit when you win, but never quit because you’re losing.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>If and when I solved this problem, I would never need money again.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>In other works, we swallowed our pride and did whatever it took to make the extra money.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>While I do occasionally flip a property, especially if someone is willing to pay me a ridiculous price for it, as a practice I would rather buy a property and collect rent and other income for a long time.  Then I look for another property to buy and hold.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>In real estate, many investors love triple net leases (NNN).  With NNN’s investors receive income without the expenses of taxes, repairs and insurance.  The tenant covers these costs.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>As they say in the world of finance, ‘I’ll give you your price, if you will give me my terms.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Henry Ford build his auto plant in Detroit because he could buy large tracts of rocky, unfertile, non-agricultural land for a great price.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Generally a person who invests for capital gains is investing on an opinion.  A cash flow investor invests for facts.  If possible a smart investor will invest using both opinion and facts, and invest for both cashflow and capital gains.  <BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Intelligence is the ability to take information and make it meaningful.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Everytime I see developers’ construction cranes sitting on high-rise condos I know the end of the trend is near.  Whenever you see construction cranes, aka birds of prey, sitting on the skyline, you know the boom is about to bust.  It means that the cycle has peaked, and generally, there is nowhere to go but down.  The next time you see more than two construction cranes on the skyline, start selling any piece of real estate you do not want.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The good news is that problems ahead will make us smarter if we take them on with courage, and do not run from them.  Inside every problem is a gem of wisdom, a gem that makes us smarter, stronger and able to do better regardless of economic conditions.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR> ‘A’ students work for the ‘C’ students, and ‘B’ students work for the government.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>I learned that if I did not feel good about myself, people did not feel good about me.  In many instances, another person is only sending back what I am broadcasting.  In other words, if I think I am a loser, other people will think of me as a loser.  The good news is that you and I can change their perceptions of us by changing our perceptions of ourselves.  For example, if I had not changed my perception of myself, I would never have met and married a beautiful woman like Kim, someone like Donald Trump wouldn’t be my friend, and I wouldn’t be financially secure today.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Entrepreneurs have two characteristics… ignorance and courage.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>One of the reasons so many ‘A’ students are not rich is because they may be smart but lack courage.  There are many people who lack both knowledge and courage.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>In the real world, courage is more important than good grades.  It takes courage to discover, develop and donate your genius to the world.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>A good friend of mine, who has been a venture capitalist for over fifty years, always says, ‘The rich don’t buy stocks; they sell stocks.’ The rich create companies and then sell the company’s shares to investors.  That is legally printing money.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The poor and the middle class work for money.  The rich have money work for them.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Your home is not an asset.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The rich invent money.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Work to learn – don’t work for money.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Texans don’t bury their failures.  They get inspired by them.  They take their failures and turn them into rallying cries.  Failure inspires Texans to become winners.  But that formula is not just the formula for Texans.  It is the formula for all winners.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Pay yourself first.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-6.html">6<a/> </p><p><BR>
