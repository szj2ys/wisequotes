<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On his mother] Her great dream for us was that we go to school.
<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
My pride in my mother was tempered with a sense of sadness that she had to bear most of our burdens.  At a very early age I began to want to relieve her in any small way I could.  I was happy whenever I had money to give her.
<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I had a lot of free time, and a lot of freedom.  Some of it I put to good use – I had a paper route, I cut grass and ran errands when I could.
<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On getting some help as a teenager from Karl Downs] It wasn’t so much what he did to help as the fact that he was interested and concerned enough to offer the best advice he could.

<BR> 
[On saving his eyesight in later years] I’ve always been a fighter, but this is one fight I could never have won alone.
<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
People in every walk of life who have written, telephoned, sent telegrams, and spared no effort to let me know that I was not a forgotten sports hero, but I am a hero whose personal struggle has reached many, black and white, and given them the courage to go on with their struggles.  It seems like they have been trying to share some of the strength they feel they got from me by responding now to me in my time of need.
<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I have always fought for my principles and spoken out for my ideals.
<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Recognition… has given me the determination to live as many more productive years as I can.
<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I had to fight hard against loneliness, abuse, and the knowledge that any mistake I made would be magnified because I was the only black man out there.  
<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
<BR>

<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I always believed in the utmost integrity.
<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>

<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>

Dadgummit!
<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On doing the broad/long jump] You [toe] the line and spring forward with all your strength.  Then you jump – you really try to jump off the earth and your legs churn the air like you wanted to reach the moon.  Then you come down to earth in soft sand and you have to remember to fall forward so that there are no marks behind the back of your heels.
<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>

<BR>

<BR><a href="jackie-robinson-quotes.html">Jackie Robinson<a/>
