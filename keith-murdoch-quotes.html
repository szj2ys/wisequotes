The power of a newspaper can be no greater than the degree of confidence its readers repose in it…
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1947] We live in a new age and the destiny of humanity depends upon the accurate informing of the people of the world; more than ever before, the public needs full, honest, strong newspapers.

[In 1925] It may not be true that every young man carries in life’s campaign for Fortune, what corresponds to a Marshal’s baton in his luncheon basket, but apart from uncertain prizes in the lottery of ambition, the practice of the common virtue of industry aided by ordinary prudence and self-restraint will be followed by a secure hold on the conditions of a goodly and prosperous life… It is sufficient to practice industry and moderation, and to observe the negative virtues of abstaining from gambling, drink, idleness and the vagabondage of the mind which wallows in thoughtless idleness, or in vacuous, expensive, and feverish pleasures.

[In 1941] My father died last June aged 90 years, with a clear mind and contentment.  His long life was well used.  He fought his fights in this country when they were necessary, but his days were indeed happy days.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1942 on his formative years.] We lived simple and homely lives with many friends, with strong family feelings and with complete confidence in the great British strength.  We weren’t as smart as you are today.  We boys wore patched-pants… We did not have a beautiful cricket ground… There the roots of my life were planted.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>

An abundance of hopeful spirits and a determination to do well.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1909] Perhaps you don’t know I came to London with great hopes of immediate success.  Of course they were the idle ideas of boyhood.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1909] Self-government is not in itself a solution to all political and social difficulties.  It is at best an instrument with which men can hold by the ideal of social justice and human progress can work.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>

[In September 1918] I have always thought the editorial side of The Herald weaker than its managerial side.  In fact The Herald has always been somewhat shapeless…

<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1918] I have much to say against stodginess, although as the Sydney Herald and many other newspapers prove, stodginess will hold a circulation better than rocky brilliance.  Human sentiment is a large part of life…
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1918] News – strong, dignified human handling of news – must be the postwar paper’s chief concern.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1921] It is the duty of the Government to lead the country on the vital and paramount issue confronting Australia today.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 1921] I think it would be disastrous if the manager over-rides the editor.  You would not have meth think otherwise for that would mean you wish me to become a mere journeyman running to others for orders.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I told him flatly I would not.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 1923] The hope that our services to the community may be destined to improve and to grow.  
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In April 1927 on ‘The Herald’s’ steady advance over 1923-1925.] These years, the evening newspaper, all over the world, had begun to come into its own.  The war brought the public to demand news as it broke – and when once introduced to the evening newspaper the public found how much more comfortable and pleasant it was to read their newspaper after the rush of work of the day was done, and how interesting it was to get the news of the day itself into their hands at that time.
