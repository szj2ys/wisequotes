Poets to this day follow the simile.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> More and more as we come closer and closer in touch with nature and its teachings are we able to see the Divine and are therefore fitted to interpret correctly the various languages spoken by all forms of nature about us.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I love to think of nature as unlimited broadcasting stations, through which God speaks to us every day, every hour and every moment of our live, if we will only tune in and remain so.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I am and more convinced, as I search for truth that no ardent student of nature, can ‘Behold the lilies of the field’; or ‘Look unto the hills’; or study even the microscopic wonders of a stagnant pool of water, and honestly declare himself to be an infidel.  <BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> To those who have as yet not learned the secret of true happiness, which is the joy of coming into the closest relationship with the Maker and Preserver of all things: begin now to study the little things in your own door yard, going from the known to the nearest related unknown for indeed each new truth brings one nearer to God.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I hope, except for emphasis, that each one of my children will rise to the full height of your possibilities, which means the possession of these eight cardinal virtues which constitutes a lady or a gentleman.  1) Be clean both inside and outside. 2) Who neither looks up to the rich or down on the poor. 3) Who loses, if need be, without squealing.  4) Who wins without bragging. 5) Who is always considerate of women, children and old people. 6) Who is too brave to lie 7) Who is too generous to cheat 8) Who takes his share of the world and lets other people have theirs.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> [To Booker T.

Once Jim came by and saw George bending over a bush.  ‘What are you doing to those flowers?’ Jim asked]  Loving them.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Please move them, ma’am.

Roses want sun.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>This summer I came near losing my life, and I am yet unable to see how I could pass through such an ordeal and yet live.  <BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR>  [A] few simple illustrations… teach us that much of our success in orchard, field and garden will depend on the closeness with which we stick to nature’s laws in the way of giving to each plant it’s proper environment.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> [The soil was so badly eroded that] we could throw an ox into a ditch and … have to look down to see it.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> [Through his efforts] Injurious washing has been almost completely overcome.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> We are richer than we think we are.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> [On expanding agricultural markets] He who puts such a product upon the market as it demands, controls that market, regardless of color.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> [Livestock had] A most important place in the economy of the farm [Since there was] an intimate and inseparable relationship existing between the fertility of the soil and the stock kept on the farm.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Map out a well defined policy and not deviate from it unless careful consultation were held, would thus avoid all of the very costly mistakes made this year.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I think it ludicrously unfair to have persons, sit in an office and dictate what I have to do and how I do it.  If I thought things were to run as they always run I would not stay here longer than I could get away.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I fully appreciated the necessity of not increasing the school’s expenses one dollar or even less but my work is of such a nature that I cannot do it without help regularly.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>If money were my only object I could not afford to stay at Tuskegee.  I came here with the one idea of assisting you in building up the most difficult division in your great scheme.  I came knowing that I would encounter more difficulties in the way of proper sympathy and support.  I knew it would not be an easy life to live.  I am not seeking that just now, neither am I seeking personal aggrandizement.  I only want to give the school my best service.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> In the beginning every teacher should realize that a very large proportion of every true student’s work must be outside the classroom.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> In regard to teaching I have always felt as you do about it, and therefore have stuck with it at the expense, frequently of the other, and more practical part, but I think I see brighter days ahead, if the Lord spares you to engineer this great work.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Few, if any, realize the wealth within our county and the ease with which we can, not only live, but can accumulate much above a living, until we see and study such a collection of evidence.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Look unto the hills from whence cometh thy help.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> [On future dyes and paints] I am sure no one realizes what a wealth we have in these clays.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> The South is going to come into its own, and is destined to be the richest part of the United States.  This part of the country is undeveloped and has peculiar possibilities on account of its climate and soil.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> My work is a great publicity asset for the school and my race.  I, with others, am clannish enough to want my people to receive credit for my work.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Peanut milk is a perfect emulsion of the oils, fats, proteins, carbohydrates and some of the ash of the peanuts.  Many different kinds of milk can be made by controlling the proportions of carbohydrates and proteins and scientifically diluting the product.  Its keeping qualities are about the same as those of cow’s milk.  It makes splendid bread, rich in flavor, and is excellent for creaming vegetables.

My parents were both slaves. Father was killed shortly after mybirth while hauling wood to town on an ox wagon.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I had three sisters and one brother. Two sisters and my brother I know tobe dead only as history tells me, yet I do not doubt it as they are buried in thefamily burying ground.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> From a child, I had an inordinate desire for knowledge, and especiallymusic, painting, flowers and the sciences, algebra being one of my favoritestudies.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Day after day, I spent in the woods alone in order to collect my floralbeauties, and put them in my little garden I had hidden in brush not far frommy house, as it was considered foolishness in the neighborhood to waste timeon flowers.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> My sister, mother and myself were kucklucked (sold as a group), and soldin Arkansas, and there are so many conflicting reports concerning them I darenot say if they are dead or alive. Mr. Carver, the gentleman who owned mymother, sent a man for us, but only I was brought back, nearly dead withwhooping cough, with the report that mother and sister were dead, althoughsome say they saw them afterwards going north with the soldiers.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Rocks had an equal fascination for me…<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> As we lived in the country no colored schools were available so I was permitted to go 8 miles to a school at town (Neosho).
