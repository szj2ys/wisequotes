I was ecstatic to join Ansett Australia as a Product Manager… I was amazed that after a few days at Ansett, I still did not yet have a PC on my desk.  I asked my manager when it would be delivered.  ‘But why do you need a PC when we have the typing pool?’ was the response.  ‘You simply dictate what you want to have written into this machine, then the next day it comes back, you make corrections, then the day after that it comes back again.’  I thought, ‘It cannot seriously take three days just to produce a document.’  It did… this was an absolute shock to me.

[In 2007.]  It is more than a decade since I had a boss… I know I was a very challenging employee.  I could never sit still.  There was always another idea, a better way of doing things that I had imagined, some information I did not yet know and needed to discover.  
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>

The idea for RedBalloon Days actually came from one of my Bright Marketing clients.  He wanted to bring the UK experiences agency Red Letter Days to Australia and approached me for some marketing input.  When he came to me with the idea, there was no initial excitement from me, more mild enthusiasm or curiosity.  I just thought, ‘That could be fun, I might put a bit of my time into it.’

Why didn’t I just give up after those initial disasters?  Well because I’d put $25,000 of my own money into it and a lot of time and energy.  Failure just doesn’t sit well with me, I just had to prove to myself I could do it…

I took to walking to meetings with red balloons attached to my briefcase.  If anyone was to ask me why, I had something to tell them, something that might excite them.  Or they just might have thought I was nuts.  Either way at that stage I didn’t care.

<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
