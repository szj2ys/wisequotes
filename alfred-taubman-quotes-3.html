My customer is a woman. It's not necessarily a family, it's a woman. She's the shopper.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>

Historically if you put three stores together, people would shop at one store and look at what the other stores have.  It was my theory if you put 50 stores together, which I started out doing, it would be even that much better.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We have 200 stores in centers. But that didn't happen like over night, it happened as a process of testing the way goods are purchased and how they're purchased.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On shopping center customer (traffic) flows.] We were the first ones to work out the traffic patterns so that we could control the traffic.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can't afford to have a organization until you make profits.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I loved being copied; it doesn't bother me at all. 
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You have to put yourself in the position of the purchaser.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People really don't want to shop in an empty shopping center. 
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
These are impulse type purchases, no one goes to a shopping center to buy a pair of hose necessarily... ...and no one goes to buy candy necessarily, they buy those things because it's there, because they can smell it, they can touch it.  That's why they buy those things.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can't afford to have a customer get tired walking in your shopping center. You have to make sure that they're comfortable.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I have sat in malls for an hour or two and watched customers. I walked the centers. I used to walk the centers almost daily wherever I could be. I've learned a lot from that.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to make it easy for the customer, that was the main thing.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The most important thing is the number of stores we put in. The more stores you put in, the more opportunity the customer has.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
They sold these goods. People didn't buy it, they sold it.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am proud of the fact that I've been able to accomplish what I've accomplished and I'm very proud of what I've done with my life since I was asked to retire.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I've been fascinated with what people do when you finance them, you give them an opportunity.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>

One of the things this country was great for was supporting innovation and supporting research.  That made a difference in our country that we've been able to withstand all this competition, based on the fact, excuse me, that we have ideas.  We can come up with ideas, original thought, which other companies and countries haven't been able to do.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Describing innovation is like describing laughter. I mean, you do it because you have the ability to do it.  Innovation is something that is God given.  It's an opportunity that your mind has a capacity to separate us from an animal that's basically the difference.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The pig has a brain similar to us, has a nervous system similar to us, very much like us… But the difference is that we can innovate, we can think, we can do things with our heads, with our brains that are unique.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>

<BR>
We have to support innovation.

I think everybody wants to be thought of as kind.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Try to think of things differently and better, not just different but better.
<BR><a href="alfred-taubman-quotes.html">Alfred Taubman<a/>
