<BR>
The boundaries between life and death are at best shadowy and vague. 
Who shall say where one ends and where the other begins?
<BR><B>Edgar Allen Poe</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Nowadays, the only occasions that seem to bring families together are weddings and funerals.
<BR><B>Julia McNamara</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
In three words I can sum up everything.  I've learned about life: it goes on.
<BR><B>Robert Frost</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I had a friend who was a clown. When he died, all his friends went to the funeral in one car. 
<BR><B>Steven Wright</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
I have a hat. It is graceful and feminine and give me a certain dignity, as if I were attending a state funeral or something. Someday I may get up enough courage to wear it, instead of carrying it. 
<BR><B>Erma Bombeck</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
When he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night,
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
<BR><B>William Shakespeare</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I remember I laughed so hard I cried. But my response was half appropriate, because I was at a funeral.

I remember when my father passed away, we drove the funeral procession past the bank so he could say one last goodbye. That's how much the bank meant to my father. 
<BR><B>Alexi Giannoulias</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Men fear death as children fear to go into the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other. 
<BR><B>Francis Bacon</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I seldom go into a natural history museum without feeling as if I were attending a funeral. 
<BR><B>John Burroughs</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Life and death are but phases of the same thing, the reverse and obverse of the same coin. Death is as necessary for man's growth as life itself.
<BR><B>Mahatma Gandhi</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I shall never forget the despair and agony on the parents' faces on the awful day of the funeral when the 13 little children, victims not only of John D. Rockefeller, but of the government of the state of Colorado were buried. 
<BR><B>Ella R Bloor</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
I have seen death too often to believe in death,
It is not an ending, but a withdrawal.
As one who finishes a long journey.
Stills the motor. Turns off the lights
Steps from the car
And walks up the path
To the home that awaits him
<BR><B>Anonymous</B>
<BR>
<BR>
A couch of thorns, or an embroidered bed, 
Are matters of indifference to the dead. 
<BR><B>Theognis of Megara</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
I know death has ten thousand several doors for men to take their exits. 
<BR><B>John Webster</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Funerals are the rituals we create to help us face the reality of death, to give us a way of expressing our response to that reality with other persons, and to protect us from the full impact of the meaning of death for ourselves. Some funerals fulfill these functions beautifully. Others fail.
<BR><B>Alla Bozarth Campbell</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.
<BR><B>J K Rowling</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I used to work in a funeral home to feel good about myself, just the fact that I was breathing. 
<BR><B>Chuck Palahniuk</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Some are bound to die young.  By dying young a person stays young in people's memory.  If he burns brightly before he dies, his brightness shines for all time. 
<BR><B>Anonymous</B>

<BR>
How could you go about choosing something that would hold the half of your heart you had to bury?
<BR><B>Jodi Picoult</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes, when one person is absent, the whole world seems depopulated
<BR><B>Allphonse de Lamartine</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Being fired has some of the advantages of dying without its supreme disadvantages. People say extra-nice things about you, and you get to hear them.
<BR><B>Howard Zinn</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The comfort of having a friend may be taken away, but not that of having had one.
<BR><B>Seneca</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
The accumulation of birthdays is the leading cause of death in the United States and other large land masses. Now while that may not be 100% accurate, it is at least 88% accurate. Actually, the last sentence itself might not have been 100% accurate, but I’m 88% sure it was. Maybe I should just brush up on fractions and percentages before making statements that are liable to hurt the funeral industry, because if birthdays aren’t killing people then it’s bad for the mortality business. And if you can’t trust somebody to die, then you can’t trust somebody. But I’m somebody you can trust. I’m at least 88% trustworthy, at least 88% of the time.
<BR><B>Jarod Kintz</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Grief is the price we pay for love.
<BR><B>Queen Elizabeth II</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to be at my sister's funeral, but my family has always had a complicated dynamic. 
<BR><B>Nick Carter</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Anything that is of value in life only multiplies when it is given.
<BR><a href="deepak-chopra-quotes.html">Deepak Chopra<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Photographs are precious memories … the visual evidence of place and time and relationships … ritual talismans for the treasure chest of the heart.
<BR><B>Robert Fulghum</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Cowards die many times before their deaths:
The valiant never taste of death but once.
<BR><B>William Shakespeare</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to make a human monster. His name is Coffin Baby. The idea is based on a group of people from Pasadena whose names I can't mention. His mother died and during the funeral, this baby came out of her in the coffin. 
<BR><B>Tobe Hooper</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Death is the veil which those who live call life:
They sleep, and it is lifted.
<BR><B>Percy Blysshe Shelley</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I want to write my own eulogy, and I want to write it in Latin. It seems only fitting to read a dead language at my funeral.
<BR><B>Jarod Kintz</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The people who pretend that dying is rather like strolling into the next room always leave me unconvinced. Death, like birth, must be a tremendous event. 
<BR><B>J B Priestley</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I've a great fancy to see my own funeral before I die. 
<BR><B>Maria Edgeworth</B>
<BR>
<BR>
We sometimes congratulate ourselves at the moment of waking from a troubled dream; it may be so the moment after death.
<BR><B>Nathaniel Hawthorne</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Remembering is an act of resurrection, each repetition a vital layer of mourning, in memory of those we are sure to meet again.
<BR><B>Nancy Cobb</B>
<BR>
<BR>
It's the circle of life, and it moves us all, 
through despair and hope, 
through faith and love, 
'till we find our place, 
on the path unwinding.
<BR><B>The Lion King</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
If anyone at my funeral has a long face, I'll never speak to him again. 
<BR><B>Stan Laurel</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
If we have another 2,000 people killed, I want Nancy Pelosi and George Soros, John Conyers and Pat Leahy to go to the funeral and say, 'Your son was vaporized because we didn't want to dump some guy's head under water for 30 seconds.' 
<BR><B>Peter King</B> 
<BR>
