<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Rage can only with difficulty, and never entirely, be brought under the domination of the intelligence, and therefore is not susceptible to any arguments whatsoever.

<BR>
<BR> 
I know that what I am asking is impossible.  But in our time, as in every time, the impossible is the least one can demand – and one is, after all, emboldened by the spectacle of human history in general and American Negro history in particular, for it testified to nothing less than the perpetual achievement of the impossible.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>

The depthless alienation from oneself and one’s people is, in sum, the American experience.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR> 
The western world has created me, given me my name; has hidden my truth as a permanent and historical fact.  I may recover from this and I may not.  I’m a grim man, old and insane enough to tell you that not many survive being born black in America.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I moved to Europe in 1948 because I was trying to become a writer and couldn’t find in my surroundings, in my own country, a certain stamina, a certain corroboration that I needed.  For example, no one ever told me that Alexandre Dumas was a mulatto.  No one told me that Pushkin was black.  As far as I knew when I was very young there’d never been anything… As far as I knew, which is much more important, there’d never been anything called a black writer.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR> 
White supremacy comes from Europe.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Your crown has been bought and paid for.  All you must do is put it on your head.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
<BR>
<BR>
The most dangerous creation of any society is the man who has nothing to lose.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
The price the white American paid for his ticket was to become white…This incredibly limited, not to say dimwitted ambition has choked many a human being to death here: and this, I contend, is because the white American has never accepted the real reasons for his journey. I know very well that my ancestors had no desire to come to this place: but neither did the ancestors of the people who became white and who require of my captivity a song. They require of me a song less to celebrate my captivity than to justify their own.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In 1970] As long as white Americans take refuge in their whiteness – for so long as they are unable to walk out of this most monstrous of traps – they will allow millions of people to be slaughtered in their name, and will be manipulated into and surrender themselves to what they will think of – and justify – as a racial war.  They will never, so long as their whiteness puts so sinister a distance between themselves and their own experience and the experience of others, feel themselves sufficiently human, sufficiently worthwhile, to become responsible for themselves, their leaders, their country, their children or their fate.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
They had been formed by the images made of them by those who had had the deepest necessity to despise them.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In 1955] The world is white no longer, and it will never be again.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
We live in an age in which silence is not only criminal but suicidal… for if they take you in the morning they will be coming for us that night.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In 1963] What passes for identity in America is a series of myths about one’s heroic ancestors.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Artists are here to disturb the peace.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
We are all androgynous, not only because we are all born of a women impregnated by the seed of a man but because each of us, helplessly and forever, contains the other – male in female, female in male, white in black and black in white.
<BR><a href="james-baldwin-quotes.html">James Baldwin<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
There exists among the intolerably degraded the perverse and powerful desire to force into the arena of the actual those fantastic crimes of which they have been accused, achieving their vengeance and their own destruction through making the nightmare real.
