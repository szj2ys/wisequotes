My father [Phil Fisher] is a great man who influenced many people, great and small, from national business leaders to students to students of his students who went into other fields.  He had a knack for getting people to see things they wouldn’t see otherwise, not by telling them but by somehow getting them to think thoughts they don’t believe they ever would have thought without interaction with him.  At times, it was like he was a mirror held up to your brain.

I can’t tell you how many people over the decades said something to me like, ‘I met him once.  It was only briefly, but he said x, y, and z, and that made me think, and that gave me the idea I used in starting my company.’  It was, of course, their idea, but they somehow credited him with some of its creation.  He brought that quality out in people.  Somehow he made people think things that they might have thought anyway, but for sure they believed they thought them because of interactions with Father.

People are scared of lots of things – federal deficits, the drug crisis, wars, escalating crime rates, even Wall Street.  You should know by now that not much of what scares people is really worthy of fear.  The financial world won’t come to an end soon due to factors like these or any others.

Going bearish when others are bullish because you see bad things others don’t is perfectly fine – in fact, blessed.  It’s also very hard to do.  You have to be sure not to go bearish when everyone else is dour, and you have to be sure the bad things you see aren’t already in the minds of others and discounted into the market.

If your adviser has access to the money because he controls or is somehow affiliated with whoever has custody of your assets, there is always, always the risk he carries your money out the back door.

The most profitable common stock investments come in the form of young, rapidly growing companies that are currently out of favor with Wall Street.

Making mistakes is less a sign of weakness than a sign of evolution.  Few companies grow at rapid rates year after year without suffering some irregularity or ‘glitch’ resulting in unfavorable earnings or even losses.

What would someone pay to buy the whole business – lock, stock and barrel?  If investors  would always ask themselves this simple question before buying stock, it would save a lot of money.  What would someone pay to buy this whole business?

If management owns substantial amounts of stock, they are the stockholder’s partners.  They have every incentive to make the shares become more valuable.  They will be particularly protective of the company’s balance sheet.

It is best if management’s stock ownership is at least 10 times its combined annual salary.

It is useless to own a stock unless it increases in value at a respectable – if irregular – rate.

Institutions can’t touch most of the stocks available to the little guy… The institutions can invest only in the bigger cap stocks.  Why?  Liquidity.

[In 1985] There are investment bargains in bankruptcy.  The problem is, most folks buy stocks before the firms go into bankruptcy.  The trick is to wait until afterward.

[In 1985] The way most people end up with $1 million in the stock market is to start out with $2 million.  That’s right.

<BR>
[In 1985] They don’t have to, but most folks lose money.  They commit three common mistakes: They overpay, buy businesses they don’t understand and neglect to take a long-term approach.  These three fatal errors account for most stock market failure.

How do you keep the stock market simple?  The answer is, don’t do things you don’t understand.

<BR>
Buying unpopular stocks of good companies.  This is the simplest kind of investing to understand – too simple for some folks.  Because these stocks are unpopular, their prices are depressed.  You get value.  Because they are good companies, you can comfortably hold them for a few years or longer.  With time, their quality will be more widely recognized and the stocks will become more popular.  As that happens, the stocks go up.  It’s that simple.

[In 1985] If you want to hold on to your money, you could do worse than developing the habit of holding on to your stocks.  A long-term orientation may sound stodgy, but it is as important to investment success as picking stocks or pricing them.
<BR><a href="kenneth-l-fisher-quotes.html">Kenneth L Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you buy right, you buy an unpopular and much depressed stock of a good business.  In time the firm’s quality will be recognized by others, and then the stock will become more popular and rise.  But no one can tell just when this will happen.

I have never ever seen anyone who could consistently outguess the market’s direction.  There are many who claim they can, but none delivers with consistency.
