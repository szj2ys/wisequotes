<BR>
<BR>
I don’t know why, but even as kid I was fascinated by airplanes.  There weren’t many of them around back then, but I’d read everything I could about them and about the men who flew them.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Charles Lindbergh flying solo in 1927 a few days after his 10th birthday.] Many others had tried, but none had done it alone.  My ear was glued to our vacuum-tube RCA radio, listening for every scratch-sounding news report on the progress of his flight.  When the bulletin came announcing that he had landed in Paris and was carried off the field on the shoulders of thousands of cheering Frenchman, I was hooked.  There was no question in my mind that I would be a pilot, just like Lindbergh.  I was certain of it.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The school was on a hill, and when class let out I’d step outside and look out over the valley and think this must be what pilots see all the time.  I wanted to see the world that way as well.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My mum and dad were great.  They never discouraged my dreams about flying, even though the idea must have seemed preposterous.  Here we were, a family of nine living on a farm out in the sticks and barely able to keep a roof over our heads, and I was jabbering on about flying airplanes.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Shortly after graduating from high school in 1934 – The way to fund his flying lessons.] Just about that time, a new outfit called White Castle opened a hamburger place in Frankfort, and it was drawing a lot of customers.  The business seemed pretty simple, so I opened my own hole-in-the-wall hamburger stand in Frankfort, but on the opposite side of the Kentucky River from my competitor.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On opening his hamburger store in 1934] business was good almost from the start.  By pricing burgers and Cokes at a nickel each, I sold a lot of them.  Trouble was, I wasn’t making any money.  So I doubled my prices (there was a volume discount, of course – a dozen burgers for a buck), and suddenly I was making money.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1937 after selling his hamburger store to his brother, completing his flying lessons and buying his first airplane for $3,500.] There weren’t any flying jobs to speak of.  Even the military had just a handful of airplanes.  So I did what many other aviators did: anything and everything.  I took people up for a dollar a hop, gave lessons, and even put on air shows.  Folks came out to see if the fool kid would kill himself, and like a fool, on several occasions I almost obliged.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his airplane seat breaking away from the cockpit with him in it. That spurred his further interest in flight safety and training.] Suddenly, the whole airplane was missing.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Training in an airplane can be hazardous.  When the unexpected occurs, take appropriate action in a timely fashion.  If at all possible, be lucky.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On starting FlightSafety] I thought about that a good while, and figured that there might be an opportunity in giving those guys a training system similar to what the airlines had.  
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you can fly a simulator, you can fly a plane, but the opposite isn’t necessarily true. The simulator can safely put you in ‘dangerous’ combinations of situations that are unlikely – but not impossible – to come up during a real flight, so you can be prepared for them.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1968 at the age of 50.] Leaving Pan Am was probably both the hardest and the most exciting moment of my career.  I loved that airline and my job, and I thought the world of Juan Trippe.  Still, the prospect of leading my own company, full time, thrilled me.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was only then, 17 years after I started the company, that I began collecting a paycheck from FlightSafety.  I had to.  I had just quit my regular job.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My good luck held again.  Warren Buffett called.  Although Warren had been sending his pilots to us for training, he and I had never met, so the contact came as surprise.  He wanted to know if I’d be interested in discussing FlightSafety’s future.  I was.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On selling FlightSafety to Warren Buffett for $1.5 billion (He took his 37 percent part all in Berkshire Hathaway shares).] We got to know each other over a couple of hamburgers and Cherry Cokes, and I liked what I saw and heard.  Warren said he’d like FlightSafety to be a part of Berkshire Hathaway, but he wanted it to remain an independent subsidiary, to continue on its same course of business, and to be run by the same people as before.  At the end of the meal – the best burger I’d eaten since selling Little Hawk [His hamburger store] – we shook hands on the deal, and by the end of December, 1996, it was done.  FlightSafety became a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We have a lot of competition.  Many airlines compete with us, selling their excess capacity.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We’re going to do our best.  We want to be the leader in this business.  
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When jets were first put into service, there were no simulators and all training was done in the aircraft.  There were more accidents in the training flights than there were in passenger flights because pilots didn’t have the opportunity to practice in the simulator.
