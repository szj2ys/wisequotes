You cannot change the circumstances, the seasons, or the wind, but you can change yourself.  That is something you have charge of.  You don't have charge of the constellations, but you do have charge of whether you read, develop new skills, and take new classes.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Your paycheck is not your employer's responsibility, it's your responsibility. Your employer has no control over your value, but you do.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It is easier to blame the government than it is your own philosophy.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>I find it fascinating that most people plan their vacations with better care than they plan their lives. Perhaps that is because escape is easier than change.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into someone else's plan. And guess what they may have planned for you? Not much.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The reason why most people face the future with apprehension instead of anticipation is because they don't have it well designed.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The guy says, "When you work where I work, by the time you get home, it's late. You've got to have a bite to eat, watch a little TV, relax, and get to bed. You can't sit up half the night planning, planning, planning." And he's the same guy who is behind on his car payment!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Learn from the negative as well as the positive, from the failures as well as the successes.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Life, in all its uniqueness, would not be life without the negatives and the positives. That is why it is important to be a serious student of both.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Life is part positive and part negative. Suppose you went to hear a symphony orchestra and all they played were little, happy, high notes? Would you leave soon? Let me hear the rumble of the bass, the crash of the cymbals, and the minor keys.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Life is a process of accumulation. We either accumulate the debt or the value, the regret or the equity.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>To solve any problem, here are three questions to ask yourself: First, what could I do? Second, what could I read? And third, who could I ask?<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The real problem is usually two or three questions deep. If you want to go after someone's problem, be aware that most people aren't going to reveal what the real problem is after the first question.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Neil Armstrong once said, "You only have to solve two problems when going to the moon: first, how to get there; and second, how to get back. The key is don't leave until you have solved both problems."<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Never attack a problem without also presenting a solution.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The best place to solve a problem is on paper.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>One person caring about another represents life's greatest value.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Your family and your love must be cultivated like a garden. Time, effort, and imagination must be summoned constantly to keep any relationship flourishing and growing.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The greatest gift you can give to somebody is your own personal development. I used to say, "If you will take care of me, I will take care of you." Now I say, "I will take care of me for you if you will take care of you for me."<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The walls we build around us to keep out the sadness also keep out the joy.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>You cannot succeed by yourself.  It's hard to find a rich hermit.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Each of us must be committed to maintaining the reputation of all of us. And all of us must be committed to maintaining the reputation of each of us.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Accuracy builds credibility.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It only takes one lie to taint your entire testimony.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The Bible gives us a list of human stones on both sides of the ledger. One list of human stories is used as examples - do what these people did. Another list of human stories is used as warnings - don't do what these people did. So if your story ever gets in one of these books, make sure they use it as an example, not a warning.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>At the end of each day, you should play back the tapes of your performance. The results should either applaud you or prod you.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The greatest form of maturity is at harvest time. That is when we must learn how to reap without complaint if the amounts are small and how to reap without apology if the amounts are big.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Life asks us to make measurable progress in reasonable time. That's why they make those fourth grade chairs so small - so you won't fit in them at age twenty-five!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>There are some things you don't have to know how it works - only that it works. While some people are studying the roots, others are picking the fruit. It just depends which end of this you want to get in on.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>To succeed in sales, simply talk to lots of people every day. And here's what's exciting - there are lots of people!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Practice is just as valuable as a sale. The sale will make you a living; the skill will make you a fortune.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Sales is a person to person business. You cannot send the sales manual out to make the sale. Sales manuals have no legs and no voice.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>In the sales profession the real work begins after the sale is made.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Sales people should take lessons from their kids. What does the word "no" mean to a child? Almost nothing!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Even if you are new in sales, you can make up in numbers what you lack in skills.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>One customer, well taken care of could be more valuable than $10,000 worth of advertising.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Good service leads to multiple sales. If you take good care of your customers, they will open doors you could never open by yourself<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>How do you deserve a fortune? Render fortunes of service.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You have to do more than you get paid for because that's where the fortune is.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Whoever renders service to many puts himself in line for greatness - great wealth, great return, great satisfaction, great reputation, and great joy.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-16.html">16<a/>  </p><p><BR>
