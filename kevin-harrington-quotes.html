The infomercial has become a mega-billion-dollar business, it has become a social institution, and it has unexpectedly become an intriguing route that makes it possible for anyone with a little drive and determination to become wealthy beyond his or her dreams…

It always amuses me when I hear people deride the infomercial as if it were a tool for parting the undereducated on the lower side of the earning’s curve from their money.  
<BR><a href="kevin-harrington-quotes.html">Kevin Harrington<a/>

<BR>
One of the world’s most powerful selling tools, the infomercial is the least recognized for its impact and selling power.  Americans alone spend millions of dollars each month buying direct-response ads on television, and the United States is now only a small part of the global market.

From my father, Charlie Harrington, I gained a love of being in business and the entrepreneurial pleasure of being my own boss.  I’d like to think I also inherited his great Irish/German innkeeper’s talent for making every stranger feel like an old friend.
<BR><a href="kevin-harrington-quotes.html">Kevin Harrington<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The root causes of too many heated conversations in the Harrington household - my mother always busting my father about the need for more money.  But those conversations had one virtue: they helped shape one of the cornerstone values behind my drive for success.

My father became a restaurateur, an entrepreneurial wildcat who over the years owned a string of pubs, nightclubs, supper clubs, bars – more than a dozen places…
<BR><a href="kevin-harrington-quotes.html">Kevin Harrington<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The years of not seeing my father changed when I was eleven.  I went to him one day and said , ‘I’d like to have a job with you at the Bachelor’s Club,’ his restaurant at the time.  This simple request market the beginning of my learning the ethic of hard work.
<BR><a href="kevin-harrington-quotes.html">Kevin Harrington<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At the age of eleven] I’d come home from school, do my homework, jump on a bus, transfer twice to reach the restaurant, and work till 11:00pm.  On Saturdays, I would come in at 11:00am to clean up from the night before and continue working until 2:30 the next morning, when I’d take a break to enjoy the breakfast buffet dad laid out for the entertainers who would be dropping in.  After that I’d clean up, usually finishing around 5:00am in the morning and finally making it home around 8:00am – almost a 24-hour workday.
<BR><a href="kevin-harrington-quotes.html">Kevin Harrington<a/>

<BR>
My father worked me hard.  If he was prince of the palace, I was the equivalent of the lowliest stable boy…
<BR><a href="kevin-harrington-quotes.html">Kevin Harrington<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At the age of eleven] I worked forty hours a week at a salary of only $1 an hour, when the national minimum wage was $1.40.  My father said, ‘I don’t know if you’re going to work as hard as the rest of the crew.’  I ran circles around everyone else.  It only took two months before my father started paying me the full $1.40.

<BR>
Some people allow a little talent to go to their heads.

The driver had been bringing in two full kegs, and then wheeling one empty and one full one back onto the truck.  My dad’s lesson was, ‘Don’t trust anybody.’  Maybe that was true in the restaurant business, where he had to assume everyone in the place was stealing from him.  Yet somehow I ended up with the opposite attitude – trusting everyone until they give me reason not to.
<BR><a href="kevin-harrington-quotes.html">Kevin Harrington<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I did learn the unhappy lesson that a lot of people are flakes, and a lot of the rest simply can’t be counted on.
<BR><a href="kevin-harrington-quotes.html">Kevin Harrington<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Four years of slaving for my father equipped me with a solid knowledge of restaurant economics and enough kitchen skills to hold down a job as an assistant chef, if I wanted one.  I was aiming higher though…
<BR><a href="kevin-harrington-quotes.html">Kevin Harrington<a/>

Messages from my mother: ‘Why would you want to have your own business – look at your father!’  Meaning: Look how hard he works and how tight the money always is for this family.
<BR><a href="kevin-harrington-quotes.html">Kevin Harrington<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had the bug.  I wanted to have a business of my own, and I wanted to make real money.
<BR><a href="kevin-harrington-quotes.html">Kevin Harrington<a/>

I found a job selling Babee Tenda safety high chairs; I put boxes up at the shopping malls that said ‘Mother-to-be?  Win a Free Gift!’  I’d go visit the ladies who filled out the little form, bringing her the free gift, and then explain the benefits of the safety high chair.  Most of the time, it was an easy sale.

Maths was my favorite subject, and I did very well in it, but much less well in English.  I don’t know if there’s any correlation to that in terms of my business success, but sometimes I wonder.

[At the age of sixteen buying his own car a brand-new 1972 MG.] Plenty of my friends from wealthy families had cars, but they were all bought for them by Daddy.  Driving out of the showroom with a car I bought from my own earnings was a very proud moment in my life.  But there was more to it than simply patting myself on the back.  It was as if the skies had opened.  If I could buy a car at age sixteen with my own money, it seemed like a promise that I could achieve almost anything I set my mind to.  What a sense of exhilaration and empowerment!
<BR><a href="kevin-harrington-quotes.html">Kevin Harrington<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I could see the gears turning in his head: This boy must be a damned good salesman if he could earn the money to buy an MG at his age.

<BR>
Selling high chairs to pregnant ladies wasn’t really what a high school kid wanted to be doing…
