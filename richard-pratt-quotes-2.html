There was a critical approach to problem solving.  These are some of the principles which form the basis of the MBA courses around the world; Jews fast-tracked many of these ideas in the talk around the family table.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>I see no particular problem with apologising for what others might have done out of ignorance and bad behaviour on their part.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>It’s simply a myth that Australia cannot compete in manufacturing.  Those Australian companies that had the foresight to invest in modern plant and equipment, and combine that with well trained, highly skilled employees are ideally placed to take on international competition.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>The computer and its myriad of potential applications has the potential to have a profound impact on Australia’s manufacturing ability to compete.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Our experience tells us that we do better in business when we’re accepted as good corporate citizens.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>I believe that if I do a lot of good things but that occasionally I am human and do a wrong thing, they [the media] will forgive me.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>I will not interfere with them when they are doing it [running the centre] well, but I will interfere with them if it is not doing well.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>[The best managers] look for ways to make things happen.  They don’t try to find reasons why things can’t happen.  They focus on what they want to achieve, not on what they want to avoid.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>You have to take into account what you can afford.  There is no point in saying you can afford a satellite or an atomic energy source when, in fact all you can afford is a better motor.  Spend at least a year, perhaps two years, finding out what plant is available.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>If you do everything that is commonsense, and leave nothing that is commonsense undone, you don’t have to do anything profound, because most people do a few things that are commonsense, and leave too many commonsense things undone.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Don’t wait for perfect information.  Have last month’s results approximately right on the first day of the new month.  That way you can begin fixing things on day one.  Always have timely information.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Always be an opportunist.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>If someone comes to me while walking across the factory floor early in the morning and says: ‘Richard I’ve got a problem; can you lend me $5,000?’ I can always say yes.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>We’d rather be approximately right at exactly the right time than exactly right at completely the wrong time.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>It has taken the business sector a long time to realise that you can reverse the old slogan: what’s good for the business is good for the community – what’s good for the community is also good for business.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>[On philanthropy] There are times that I think it’s a way of buying respect.  But then I discount that – you don’t buy respect; you get respect by giving respect.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>I don’t want a headquarters, I want everyone to be able to grow.  I’ve avoided anything like a bureaucracy here.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>During the day 100 per cent of the boss’s time should be spent communicating with employees, customers, suppliers, bankers and others vital to the business.  Thinking and planning should be done after hours.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Go to the factories and talk to people.  The people who make things have common sense.  They will tell you where the problem is.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>There’s these two young girls walking through a valley when a frog comes up and says to one of them: ‘If you kiss me, I’ll turn into a very, very rich corrugated-box manufacturer.  I’ll have recycling factories in every city – in fact, all over the world!  We’ll have so much money, we’ll live happily ever after, rich and successful.  Instead of kissing the frog, the girl took it and put it in her handbag.  Shocked, her friend said: ‘Hey, it’s just a peck on the cheek!  Why don’t you do it?’  And the other girl said” ‘You can’t fool me.  There’s more money in talking frogs than corrugated boxes!’<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>When you have a problem, put your smartest people in a room, outline the problem and soon they’ll have told you the when, where, who and what of how to fix it.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>If you don’t know get help.  Only stupid people don’t ask questions or don’t ask for help when they need it.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>If our competitors knew everything we discussed in our meetings, they’d be more confused than ever.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Bad meetings can produce good results, especially if you include people who want the same objectives but have different ways of getting them.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Don’t blame anything except your inability to anticipate.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>It’s easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Sending people overseas is a great educational and confidence building experience for them.  At all times you should have at least two people travelling overseas, learning and growing.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Laws, attitudes and circumstances are constantly changing around the world.  Opportunities are constantly presenting themselves.  Who knows what is possible?  Who knows what is permitted?<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>The bigger you get the more difficult it is to communicate.  You have to have boosters to make sure the message comes through loud and clear.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>In every communication there’s a transmitter and a receiver.  Messages are not transferred if either one is malfunctioning.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Are you at your peak in the mornings or the evenings?  Plan around your peak performance times.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>I reserve the right to change any decision the minute the meeting finishes.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Capacity equals sales.  Capacity should push sales and sales should push capacity.  Salespeople should talk to production people directly, and production people should talk directly to salespeople.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Q: How long does it take a greengrocer with four successful shops to turn around an unsuccessful shop once he takes it over?  A: As soon as he walks in the door the shop begins to turn around.  (If you thought the answer was ‘it depends’ you might have more success as an academic than as a businessman.)<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Who are the heroes of your company?  Where are the hot spots?  Where are the blockages?<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>My formula for growth is to support successful people and continually create opportunities for them.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Do everything that is common sense.  If you do everything that’s common sense and leave nothing out, you don’t have to do anything profound.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Business people have no rights, just obligations and opportunities.  Only customers have rights, provided they let you make a profit.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>Never say ‘Get it at any price’.  Get it and get the best price.<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR>My mother always asked the salesman, ‘Is that your best price?’  A perfectly reasonable question.  I wonder, do we always ask for the best price?<BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">Richard Pratt<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="richard-pratt-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="richard-pratt-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="richard-pratt-quotes-3.html">3<a/> </p><p><BR>
