She [Chrisann Brennan] and I were not really even going out when she got pregnant.  She just had a room in our house. <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I knew that she was not the person I wanted to marry, and we would never be happy, and it wouldn’t last long.  I was all in favor of her getting an abortion, but she didn’t know what to do.  She thought about it repeatedly and decided not to, or I don’t know that she ever really decided – I think time just decided for her.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>When I did find out he was twenty-three when he got Joanne pregnant with me, I thought, whoa!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>28% of the male population in the United States could be the father.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I wish I had handled it differently.  I could not see myself as a father then, so I didn’t face up to it.  But when the test results showed she was my daughter, it’s not true that I doubted it.  I agreed to support her until she was eighteen and give some money to Chrisann as well.  I found a house in Palo Alto and fixed it up and let them live there rent-free.  Her mother found her great schools which I paid for.  I tried to do the right thing.  But if I could do it over, I would do a better job.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[Lisa – Local integrated systems architecture] Obviously it was named for my daughter.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We are inventing the future.  Think about surfing on the front edge of a wave.  It’s really exhilarating.  Now think about dog-paddling at the tail end of that wave.  It wouldn’t be anywhere near as much fun.  Come down here and make a dent in the universe.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Since you’re so passionate about it, I’ll give you six days to prove me wrong.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The best way to predict the future is to invent it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>People who are serious about software should make their own hardware.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>A sh*thead who sucks.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I will let you invest a million dollars in Apple if you will open the kimono at PARC.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Let’s stop this bullsh*t!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Xerox’s GUI system] You’re sitting on a gold mine.  I can’t believe Xerox is not taking advantage of this.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It was like a veil being lifted from my eyes.  I could see what the future of computing was destined to be.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>This is it!  We’ve got to do it!  How long would this take to implement?  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Picasso had a saying – ‘good artists copy, great artists steel’ – and we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>They [Xerox] were copier-heads who had no clue about what a computer could do.  They just grabbed defeat from the greatest victory in the computer industry.  Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>And I want to be able to use it on Formica and my blue jeans.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We knew they hadn’t done it right, and that we could – at a fraction of the price.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Everything you’ve ever done in your life is sh*t, so why don’t you come work for me?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We were pretty worried about you.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>There was a tug-of-war between people like me, who wanted a lean machine, and those from HP, like Couch, who were aiming for the corporate market.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I was upset and felt abandoned by Markkula.  He and Scotty felt I wasn’t up to running the Lisa division.  I brooded about it a lot.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Okay.  I will give him zero.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Apple IPO] Tell me what happens to this stock that we priced at eighteen?  Don’t you sell it to your good customers?  If so, how can you charge me a 7% commission?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I never worried about money.  I grew up in a middle-class family, so I never thought I would starve.  And I learned at Atari that I could be an okay engineer, so I always knew I could get by.  I was voluntarily poor when I was in college and India, and I lived a pretty simple life even when I was working.  So I went from fairly poor, which was wonderful, because I didn’t have to worry about money, to being incredibly rich, when I also didn’t have to worry about money.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I watched people at Apple who made a lot of money and felt they had to live differently.  Some of them bought a Rolls-Royce and various houses, each with a house manager and then someone to manage the house managers.  Their wives got plastic surgery and turned into these bizarre people.  This was not how I wanted to live.  It’s crazy.  I made a promise to myself that I’m not going to let this money ruin my life.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[Steve gave his parents $750k worth of stock] It was the first time in their lives they didn’t have a mortgage.  They had a handful of their friends over for the party, and it was really nice.  Still, they didn’t consider buying a nicer house.  They weren’t interested in that.  They had a life they were happy with.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’ve got to learn to keep my feelings private.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>How many of you are virgins?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>When I went to school, it was right after the sixties and before this general wave of practical purposefulness had set in.  Now students aren’t even thinking in idealistic terms, or at least nowhere near as much.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The idealistic wind of the sixties is still at our backs, though, and most of the people I know who are my age have that ingrained in them forever.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Jef [Raskin] was really pompous.  He didn’t know much about interfaces.  So I decided to nab some of his people who were really good, like Atkinson, bring in some of my own, take the thing over and build a less expensive Lisa, not some piece of junk.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We can make a computer that’s cheaper and better than Lisa, and get it out first.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>They wanted to humor me and give me something to do, which was fine.  It was like going back to the garage for me.  I had my own ragtag team and I was in control.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To Andy Herzfeld] Are you any good?  We only want really good people working on the Mac, and I’m not sure you’re good enough.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To Andy Herzfeld] I’ve got good news or you.
