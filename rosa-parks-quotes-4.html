We could not eat in the same restaurants.  We could not even drink from the same water fountains.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> We had to stay apart from white people everywhere we went.  This was called segregation.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> Segregation was the law in the South.  If we broke the law, we could be arrested, or hurt, or even killed.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> When we rode a bus, we could only sit in the back seats.  The front seats were just for white people.  If all the front seats were filled with white people, we black people had to give up our seats to the next white people who got on the bus.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> [When I was younger]  I rode the buses and obeyed the laws that kept me apart from white people.  But I did not think they were right.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> I went to court.  The judge said I was guilty of breaking the law [not giving up her seat to a white person].  I was fined ten dollars, plus four dollars in court costs.  I never paid it.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> A woman named Jo Ann Robinson said we should not ride the buses if we had to give up our seats to white people… This was called a boycott [To stay off the buses for one day].  The day of the boycott came.  The buses were almost empty.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> [On whether she has any children]  No, I do not have any children born from me, but I consider all children as mine.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>[On her favorite food]  I like all vegetables.  Broccoli, greens, sweet potatoes, and string beans are my favorites.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> [On whether she has any bad days.]  All of my days are good!  I am grateful for each day that is given to me.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> [On whether she finished college] No, I never attended college, although it was one of my greatest desires.  I believe that every child should have the opportunity to go to college, vocational school, or technical training school after graduation from high school.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> My own experiences and the changes I have lived to see in this world have taught me that we must do what is right and not harm one another.  <BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> It takes courage to grow up and reach your highest potential, not violence.  We must respect and care for one another so that we all can live and be free.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> If I can save one life by writing to you, I believe I have done something worthwhile.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> Many times we as adults seek to teach students… without giving you examples of what the true meanings of words are so that you can learn from them.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> Hope is wanting something that means a lot to you.  It is like wanting something that you do not have.  Hope is something we feel with our hearts.  When we hope for something with our hearts, it becomes an expectation.  Hope is also something we believe in.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> A friend of mine, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, says, ‘We must keep hope alive.’  I agree.  You can help keep hope alive by believing in yourself.  Your hope for yourself and for the future can make this world a better place to live.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> A person can have more than one role model, and that is good…  there is not one person who knows everything.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>I list my husband, Raymond Parks, among the persons I admired the most.  He was good, full of courage and quiet strength.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> My mother, Leona McCauley, helped me to grow up feeling proud of myself and black people.  She taught me not to judge people by what they have.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> My Grandma Rose helped me to be a strong woman by setting an example with her own strong will and love for her children.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> Dr Martin Luther King Jr, set a profound example for me in living day to day with determination and dignity.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> It is easy for others to say that we have come a long way, but our journey is not over.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> Love, not fear, must be our guide.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> I did not give up my seat because I was tired.  I did not think of being physically tired.  My feet were not hurting.  I was tired in a different way.  I was tired of seeing so many men treated as boys and not called by their proper names or titles.  I was tired of seeing children and women mistreated and disrespected because of the color of their skin.  I was tired of Jim Crow laws, of legally enforced racial segregation.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> I thought of the pain and the years of oppression and mistreatment that my people have suffered.  I felt that way every day.  December 1, 1955, was no different.  Fear was the last thing I thought of that day.  I put my trust in the Lord for guidance and help to endure whatever I had to face.  I knew I was sitting in the right seat.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> My family talked about wearing our clothes to bed so we would be ready to escape our house if we had to.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> My grandfather never seemed afraid.  He was a proud man who believed in protecting his home.  When the hate crimes, escalated, he sat up many nights with his shotgun.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>I had no idea that history was being made.  I was just tired of giving in.  Somehow, I felt what I did was right by standing up to that bus driver.  I did not think about the consequences.  I knew that I could have been lynched, manhandled, or beaten when the police came.  I chose not to move, because I was right.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> School is one of the most important developments of life that a student can experience if it is not taken for granted.  <BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> Each person in life has certain gifts or talents to give back to life.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> To all of you, I have one message: Work hard, do not be discouraged, and in everything you do, try to do your best.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> We are all leaders of something in life.  You are a leader.  Start leading, and the others will soon follow.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> Many young people ask me about how a person’s legacy can affect future generations.  A legacy is something that is handed down to us by our ancestors.  It is not something that we ask for.  It is something that we pass down to future generations.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> My grandmother, mother, and grandfather all nurtured me.  They taught me hope and kindness and gave me a sense of inner strength.  They gave me a beautiful legacy to understand that we all count.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> I have been blessed to have lived long enough to share the legacy of my husband, Raymond Parks.  He believed that just laws should be applied equally for the benefit of all humanity.  He also believed strongly, as did my mother, in the benefits of education.  He encouraged me to obtain my high school diploma, which I did two years after we were married, when I was 21 years old.  Today I continue to do all I can to teach young people the value of a good education.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> Long ago I set my mind to be a free person and not to give in to fear.  I always felt that it was my right to defend myself if I could.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> I have learned over the years that when one’s mind is made up, this diminishes fear; knowing what must be done does away with fear.<BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">Rosa Parks<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="rosa-parks-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="rosa-parks-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="rosa-parks-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="rosa-parks-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="rosa-parks-quotes-5.html">5<a/>  </p><p><BR>
