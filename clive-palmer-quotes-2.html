[At age 29] I thought I’d retire, but all my friends had to go to school and they all had mortgages, so it was a pretty lonely sort of a life. So in 1984, it was, I established Mineralogy, our minerals company, and we took over large iron ore deposits in Western Australia. And everyone thought I was crazy.

<BR>
[On his first wife who passed away from cancer] Even though she’s gone, her love still sustains me in many things that I do, and you know I think about the things she’s taught me and what she’s done, and I’m very grateful to God that that’s happened in my life.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I do say some terrible infuriating things. I say, ‘Did I really say that?’ when I go home and think about it.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If I've got any power or influence it's because of the strength of my ideas, not for how much money I've got…
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m not motivated by the money I can guarantee you that…

<BR>
I was born in Melbourne in the mid 50s. My mum, she was what you would call a one-eyed mother - you know, she thought she had a good son, so she’d support him through and through. We came to Queensland in 1963.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[An amassing a personal fortune of about $40 million by the time he turned 29 years of age and then ‘retired’. I] Got fatter and more boring as time went by.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I knew Sir Joh [Bjelke-Petersen] very well.  I think people underestimated him.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Sir John Bjelke-Petersen] You have to remember a few things about the man.  When he was elected in the 1960s, Lyndon Johnson was president of the US and the world was a very different place.  Back then we didn’t have ports in Gladstone, we didn’t have private railways and we couldn’t mine coal.  Sir Joh fought the bureaucracy which was arguing we shouldn’t export coal, that we should be saving it for our own use.  He had to be tough and controversial to get it done and now Queensland is the biggest exporter of coal in the world.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen] He told me his government had decided the Gold Coast was where the action was going to be in tourism and he had a responsibility to make it work.  He said every high-rise development created 7000 jobs and often the developers went broke, which happened in that particular case, and when the receivers came in the units were sold off relatively cheaply and that’s exactly what happened.

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On becoming interested in the mining industry due to media reports in the middle of  the 1980’s about the Russians being keen to do joint-venture deals on iron-ore with other countries] I took a team of 20 over there and we had a meeting with Mikhail Gorbachov.  That relationship endures today.  I had dinner with Vladimir Putin a few months ago.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I haven’t got time.  I work 15 hours a day.  It’s an interesting life and full of change.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A friend of mine asked his wife the other day why we as humans get married?  He told her we get married so we have someone to share all the conversations of life.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the key to running a good business] Not rushing ahead too quickly is important, as is the ability to stay calm.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am a calm person, and others may not think so, but I have to be, because I’ve got a lot of things happening all the time.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2008] China represents a quarter of the world.  Are they going to be kept down, stricken with poverty in so many areas, forever?  I don’t think so.  It’s better to talk than have them come here and fight us for our resources.  China is focused on China… it’s not thinking to invade other countries.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2008] The Chinese have more economic muscle than America.

<BR>
Having the jet at the players’ disposal will be good for team bonding.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes I'm wrong, sometimes I'm right. I'm happy to promote debate and let people know who I am.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>

<BR>
It's very difficult when you get older to make friends, for everybody.

<BR>
You can only sleep in one bed, you can only have one meal, you can only go out with one woman at a time if you're a smart guy.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I've failed more than anyone else has in the world, but I've kept on going, because I know that failure is not necessarily a sign of saying who I am or what my character is, you know.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the challenges in life is to accept change and to move with it and realise everything we do every day, tomorrow's different and not to be frightened of that change. Too many of us hark back to where we've come from and it's always better in life to look to where you're going I think and realise that you've got to change and not be frightened if you made mistakes or if you fail.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The US Constitution tells us it's the right of everyone to pursue happiness, but it doesn't tell us how to become happy.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I've become happy by being grateful for everything I've got, and every Australian can be grateful for the air that we breathe, the sunshine, the place we live, the freedom we have, our partners, our family, our children whatever we are, there's a lot to be grateful of, you know.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We don't become happy by complaining. We don't become happy by being negative. We don't become happy by trying to take from someone else and give to someone else or feel inadequate of who we are. We only become happy by realising who we are, being happy with ourselves and then being grateful for what we've got and that melts into being happy, so that was something important to me.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was retired for about a year or so. I put on as much weight as I've probably got now. [2012]
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I thought at 29 there must be more to life than this, so I realised at this time, being able to work, being able to contribute is a sacred thing that we've all got and it's something that really develops us.   So I didn't want to work for money anymore, I wanted to work for being able to do things I thought were important and enjoy, and that's what I've done. 
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A lot of life is a propaganda…
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Very few people will understand you if you're in public life or something like at the moment, I'm more of a commodity than a human being and that's the wrong way to look at things.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Work hard and do your best in all situations…
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It doesn't matter how much money you've got, you can only sleep in one bed at a time. You can try two beds, but it’s not very good if you do.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The best experience in my life is going to bed cuddling up to someone, knowing that I love them at night, knowing that they keep the pillow warm and that I'm relevant to them that's what's important to me.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm not a political leader, I'm chairman of a company.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We can all really do what everyone else can do… You don't have to worry about failing.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think I went out into real estate in 1974 75 and we worked for a group that was precisely set up to look after projects that had failed and that group and I made quite a bit of money in those days looking at projects that had failed and, you know, the old Chinese symbol for danger is opportunity, and then I realised that in a lot of failures there's a lot of opportunity, so I started looking at things that failed in life and people who had failed and saw what was wrong and tried to change them.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When we don't succeed at something, it doesn't mean that we are failures…
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his wife] I’m the boss of the family and I’ve got her permission to say so.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I can’t control what the media does.
<BR><a href="clive-palmer-quotes.html">Clive Palmer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We’re going to build the Titanic together.  Put it on the London to New York run, and as a memory to all the people who worked on it.
