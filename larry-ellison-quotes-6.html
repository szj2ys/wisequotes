[In September 2009] We want to be T.J. Watson Jr.'s IBM.  That was when IBM was the dominant software company. And they translated that position into being a great systems company.  Back then, IBM wasn't just a company - it was the ‘environment’ in which everything else operated.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I enjoy competition. I think life is a series of acts of discovery.  We're all interested in discovering our own limits.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998] I used to buy custom, but now I’m a big fan of Brioni.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998] Oracle develops software to manage information.  We’re a database software company.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The reason I’ve been working more is it’s an extraordinary opportunity.  Our industry is going through this tectonic change.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998] Eventually the world is going to move to the internet.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998] The whole idea of putting a floppy disk into a PC and loading software is ridiculous.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998 versus a network pc.] The whole idea of backing up your data on your PC is ridiculous.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998] It’s all wrong.  Lot’s of little computers is a terrible idea.  You can’t see the big picture because it’s all been sliced and diced and stored in so many locations… It’s impossible to know what’s going on.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There’s only one program that’s important on your PC.  And that’s an internet browser.  Once you have access to the internet you have access to almost everything computing has to offer.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The primary reason people buy PC’s these days is to access the internet… The vision is absolutely coming true.

Some people thought I’d lost my mind.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998 on Oracle.] We’re nothing but 100% internet.  If we’re wrong.  We’re toast.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998] Bill [Gates] and I used to be friends a long time ago.  That’s before he turned mean and ran Netscape out of business… So I don’t talk to Bill anymore.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998] I didn’t take off three months… I’ve never been gone for more than a month at Oracle in my life.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being divorced three times so far in 1998.] I’ve been in fairly serious relationships most of my life.  It’s true.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998] I like putting myself in demanding, challenging situations.  But not to the point where my life is really at risk.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>

<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998] I work very hard at being a good CEO for Oracle.  But at the same time I can’t stop living my life.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998] Life is a miracle and I don’t want to spend it just doing Oracle.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1998] The most exciting race is…  The race towards internet computing.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being the richest man briefly for one month.] That was one hell of a month.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft's in first place. We're in second place. We're trying to catch them. They're not making it easy.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Microsoft in December 2007] They have a monopoly. We don't. Darn it.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I was a kid, my sister walked into my room and said, 'Larry, which is more important to you – to be admired or be loved?' And I said, 'Well, for me personally? To be admired.' She looks at me, smiles, 'Wrong,' and walks out. It took me a little while to realize that all of us want to be loved. Being loved is more important than being admired. It's something we have a hard time accepting
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On learning he was adopted at age 12.  Adopted by his Aunt and Uncle.] It was shocking that I just put it away and thought about it for years, without really confronting all and realizing all of the implications.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[His adopted father telling him] He told me ‘I’d never amount to anything.’… I had all the disadvantages required for success.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his adopted father.] I think, because I was constantly questioning authority, that he felt that would continuously get me in trouble as it had in school - as it had in the Boy Scouts, as it had on athletic teams.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On IBM having an idea that described how software could analyze data.  But IBM management didn’t act on the idea.  Forming the embryo to start Oracle.]  I said, 'Oh my God, this is exactly what we need to do. We can beat IBM to market with IBM's own technology,' because IBM didn't believe in their own idea.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On building a house on 33 acres in California called ‘Sanbashi’. Which started back in 1997 and has cover over $100 million in 2007.] Not a single nail on the property.  It’s all assembled in the traditional Japanese way.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his house ‘Sanbashi’.] The garden is really a piece of sculpture. And the rocks are supposed to look like they were placed here by the hand of God over the last million years
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It's not sufficient I succeed. Everyone else must fail.  That quote I actually got when I was working in Japan.  And a Japanese executive was describing a competition in Japan and how they take competition in Japan and the pursuit of market share. And this guy said, 'Anything less than a 100, you know, a 100 percent market share was not enough. Every time we lose a deal, we feel that rice is being taken out of the mouths of our children.’
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I suppose you can say to anyone who wants to win so badly, who am I winning for? Am I winning for Oracle shareholders or is this simply a matter of personal vanity? I admit to it, mea culpa. An awful lot of it is personal vanity. I think we are curious about ourselves.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We're curious about our own limits and we try to discover our own limits. And a lot of what keeps me going and keeps my drive is I'm curious as to how far I can go, how far Oracle can go. They're inextricably linked.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the story of him flying a plane under the Golden Gate Bridge.] That would be against aviation rules, so of course not.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was born in New York City.  My mother was 19, she wasn’t married and was unable to care for me and tried until I was 9 months old and then I was adopted by my maternal aunt and uncle in Chicago.  And I moved to Chicago.
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believed until I was 12 years old that I was not adopted.  I had no idea that I was adopted. 
<BR><a href="larry-ellison-quotes.html">Larry Ellison<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I had some teachers when I was very young who I thought were trying to tell me things that I thought weren’t true… They weren’t interested in a discourse with a child… They said ‘This is true and you are smart if you can repeat back to me exactly what I said to you.’  I had a real problem with that as well.
