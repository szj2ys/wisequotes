Modesty prevented me telling my condition to strangers.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I knit Crochet, and made all my hose mittens etc. while I was in school.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I was so frail and sick that they thought of course that I would die within a few days.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> When just a mere tot in short dresses my very soul thirsted for an education.  I literally lived in the woods.  I wanted to know every strange stone, flower, insect, bird or beast.  No one could tell me.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> My only book was an old Webster’s Elementary Spelling Book.  I would seek the answer here without satisfaction.  I almost knew the book by heart.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Every year I went to school, supporting myself by cooking and doing all kinds of house work in private families.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> [At the age of 19] I had not improved much in stature, as I rode on a half-fare ticket.  The conductor thought I was rather small to be traveling alone.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> In working for others I had learned the minutia of laundering.  I opened a laundry for myself; got all I could do.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>[To a college in Iowa] I was admitted, but when the President saw that I was colored he would not receive me.  I had spent nearly all of my money, and had to open a laundry here.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Mr [Booker T.] Washington said he needed a man of my training.  I accepted and came to Tuskegee nearly 27 years ago, and have been here ever since.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I asked the Great Creator what the universe was made for. ‘Ask for something more in keeping with that little mind of yours,’ he replied. What was man made for?  Little man, you still want to know too much. Cut down the extent of your request and improve the intent.” Then I told the Creator I wanted to know all about the peanut. He replied that my mind was too small to know all about the peanut, but He said he would give me a handful of peanuts. And God said, ‘Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of the earth—to you it shall be meat.’  I carried the peanuts into my laboratory and the Creator told me to take them apart and resolve them into their elements. With such knowledge as I had of chemistry and physics I set to work to take them apart. I separated the water, the fats, the oils, the gums, the resins, sugars, starches, pectoses, and amino acids. There! I had the parts of the peanuts all spread out before me. I looked at Him and He looked at me. ‘Now you know what the peanut is,’ He said.  “Why did you make the peanut?” I asked.  The Creator said, ‘I have given you three laws; namely, compatibility, temperature, and pressure. All you have to do is take these constituents and put them all together, observing these laws and I will show you why I made the peanut.’  I therefore went on to try different combinations of the parts under different conditions of temperature and pressure and the result is what you see.”<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> For eight years the Tuskegee station has made the subject of soil improvement a special study, emphasizing the subject of crop rotation, deep plowing, terracing, etc., keeping in mind the poor tenant farmer with one-horse equipment; so therefore, every operation performed has been within his reach, the station having only one horse.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Unkindness to anything means an injustice to that thing. If I am unkind to you I do you an injustice, or wrong you in so me way. On the other hand, if I try to assist you in every way that I can to make a better citizen and in every way to do my very best for you, I am kind to you. The above principles apply with equal force to the soil. The farmer whose soil produces less every year, is unkind to it in some way; that is, he is not doing by it what he should; he is robbing it of some substance it must have, and he becomes, therefore, a soil robber rather than a progressive farmer.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> We take this very book, here - go way back here, almost to the beginning of time and we find.....the farmers were obliged to rest their lands and every fifty years was jubilee year. This was picnic time for the soil. Nothing must be taken off of it. Everything it produced was to go back to the soil. Now then, you know as well as I know that ever since that time we have heard such terms as diversify, diversify, diversify-rest your soil. We paid absolutely no attention to it.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I never grope for methods; the method is revealed at the moment I am inspired to create something new. With our God to draw aside the curtain, I would be helpless.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I never have to grope for methods: the method is revealed at the moment I am inspired to create something new.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I regret exceedingly that such a gross misunderstanding should arise as to what was meant by Divine inspiration. Inspiration is never at variance with information; in fact, the more information one has the greater will be the inspiration.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> And you shall know science and science shall set you free, because science is truth.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Science is simply the truth about anything.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I ask the Great Creator ... to permit me to speak to Him through the three great Kingdoms of the world, which He has created, the animal, mineral and vegetable Kingdoms.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> They want to hear what I have to say; they will not be interested in how I look.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I do not know of a single case — that is, I mean [a] normal [person] — that complains because peanuts hurt them.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> The peanut comes in, I think, for one of the most remarkable crops … It has possibilities that we are just beginning to find out.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Here is a breakfast food. I am very sorry that you cannot taste this, so I will taste it for you. [Laughter] Now this is a combination and, by the way, one of the finest breakfast foods that you or anyone else has ever seen. It is a combination of the sweet potato and the peanut, and if you will pardon a little digression here. <BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Here is the original salted peanut, for which there is an increasing demand, andhere is a very fine peanut bar. The peanut bar is coming into prominence in a way that very few of us recognize, and the manufacturers of this peanut bar have learned that it is a very difficult matter to get a binder for it, something to stick it together. That is found in the sweet potato syrup. …<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Now here is a very attractive product — an instant coffee. … Here is a bottle of Worcestershire sauce. … Now here is a very highly flavored sauce that imitates the Chinese sauce that enters into chop suey and the various Chinese confections that they are so very fond of. …  <BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> [Mr. CAREW: Did you make all of these products yourself?] Yes, sir. They are made there in the research laboratory. That is what the research laboratory is for. …  The sweet potato products now number 107 up to date. … The peanut products are going to beat the sweet-potato products by far. I have just begun with the peanut. So what is going to come of it why we do not know.  This is the very last thing. Now this is a pomade. That is, it is a face cream and will be attractive to the ladies …<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> If we think of how the peanut is used, it is the only thing that is universally used among civilized and uncivilized people, and all sorts of animals like it, and I do not know of a single case — that is, I mean normal — that complains because peanuts hurt them.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>Of all the get-rich-quick schemes there is probably none more productive of delusion than that of poultry raising on paper.  And yet, with proper facilities and applied intelligence… handsome returns can be had from poultry.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> What’s the matter?  Too much sun?  Too little sun?<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> When you can do the common things of life in an uncommon way, you will command the attention of the world.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> Anything will give up its secrets if you love it enough. Not only have I found that when I talk to the little flower or to the little peanut they will give up their secrets, but I have found that when I silently commune with people they give up their secrets also – if you love them enough.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> And the thing that pleases me most is the fact that you are a very young man and have caught the vision, which means that you are going to keep the progressive fires burning until they act as a leaven and stir up the mass of thinkers, as it is beginning to do already.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> I am not a finisher… I am a blazer of trails.  Others must take up the various trails of truth, and carry them on.<BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">George Washington Carver<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="george-washington-carver-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="george-washington-carver-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="george-washington-carver-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="george-washington-carver-quotes-4.html">4<a/> </p><p><BR>
