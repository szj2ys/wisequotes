<BR>
The general public, not versed in marketing speak, saw it in much the same way as we did.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you take on established brands, many of whom have near monopolies, you expect everything to be thrown at you to weaken your position.  We have had to put up with these sorts of attacks for many years.  Vast amounts of money are spent spinning stories in an attempt to damage your proposition, or preferably to smother it before it gets established.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the British business establishment] Apart from a few exceptions, post-war Britain has bred a domestic commercial culture that is anti-competitive, cartel-based, and patriarchal.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Staff should come first; if it means making 5 million pounds less, then that is the right decision to make.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m not good with figures.  I failed my elementary maths exam.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I get the best people, I ask questions, and then I say: ‘lets have some fun.’
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When a company gets to a certain size, instead of letting it grow bigger and bigger and putting it into bigger and bigger offices, I will take say, the assistant marketing manager, the assistant managing director, the assistant sales manager, and I’ll say: you’re now the manager of a new company.  This was the case with Virgin records which was eventually divided into five companies.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What I like most of all is to learn.  When I feel that I’ve learnt what there is to know about telecommunications, or airlines, or cosmetics – well you name it – then I move on to something else.  It’s like being at university, which I never went to, and taking crash courses.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Southwest Airlines and the employees buying into the business] They are in the business to make a difference.  This is what a brand should stand for.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe there is almost not limit to what a brand can do, but only if used properly.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Virgin brand’s widening appeal] Four years ago we crossed into appealing to their parents.  But we have to be careful we don’t lose the kids.  I’d like people to feel most of their needs in life can be filled by Virgin.  The absolutely critical thing is we must never let them down.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What I call ‘Mars Syndrome’ infects every marketing department and advertising agency in the country.  They think that brands only relate to products and that there is a limited amount of stretch that is possible.  They seem to have forgotten no-one has a problem playing a Yamaha piano, having ridden a Yamaha motorbike that day, or listening to a Mitsubishi stereo in a Mitsubishi car, driving past a Mitsubishi bank.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you know how to motivate and deal with people, it doesn’t matter whether you are taking on the airline industry, the soft drinks industry or the film industry.  The same rules apply.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You should never go into an industry just with the purpose of making money.  
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One has to passionately believe it is possible to change the industry, to turn it on its head, to make sure that it will never be the same again.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
With the right people… anything is possible.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you have 20 or 30 years of good reputation behind you, the public get to know you like you’re a brother or sister.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes you have to take some risk in developing a brand.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Virgin staff are not mere hired hands.  They are not managerial pawns in some gigantic chess game.  They are entrepreneurs in their own right.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What I do best is finding people and letting them work.

<BR>
<BR>
We are careful not to associate ourselves with products we cannot be proud of.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One should just get on with it and learn from mistakes.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I love what I do because every single day I’m learning something new.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Every time a business gets too big, we start a new one.  Keeping things small means keeping things personal.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We don’t invest in land or expand by buying other large companies.  Setting up companies is my skill.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When we see an opportunity or gap, we start a new division.  Every time a business gets too big, we start another one.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A general rule of thumb here is that once a business gets too big to know everyone by their first name, then it is time to break it up.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m lucky.  I can talk to people.  When I first came to London as a teenager, it was such a lonely place to be.  Now people come up to me in the streets or on the underground.  I am lucky to know everybody.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Have faith in yourself.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Believe that anything can be done.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Live life to the full.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Never give up.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
People will always try to talk you out of ideas and say: ‘It can’t be done’ but if you have faith in yourself you’ll find you can achieve almost anything.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am still learning and hope I never stop.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe in goals.  It’s never a bad thing to have a dream, but I’m practical about it.  I don’t sit daydreaming about things that are impossible.  I set goals and then work out how to achieve them.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Anything I want to do in life I want to do well and not half-heartedly.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
At school, I found reading and writing hard.  Back then, dyslexia wasn’t understood and my teachers just thought I was lazy.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I taught myself to learn things by heart.  Now I have a very good memory and it has become one of my best tools in business.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A journey of a thousand miles starts with that first step.  If you look ahead to the end, and all the weary miles between, with all the dangers you might face, you might never take that first step.
<BR><a href="richard-branson-quotes.html">Richard Branson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Whatever it is you want to achieve in life, if you don’t make the effort, you won’t reach your goal.
