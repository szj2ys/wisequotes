[On not knowing a single Triad member] I don’t need them and I don’t like them.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The whole world is corrupt.  It’s only a matter of degree.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Just before the liberalisation of the gaming industry in Macau] What will happen to Macau in the future?  Let me tell you.  Macau has no natural resources.  The industry [manufacturing] is almost gone… So if the government can’t rely on the sale of land, can’t rely on industry what else can it rely on?  Really, the future is still tourism and gambling.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his companies early success acting as a middleman between the Macau authorities and the Japanese military] The company’s objective was to provide food for Macau during those years and eight months of war.  I had to start learning Japanese and Portuguese, because my job was to barter between the two.  The Portuguese government supplied us with all the surplus they could afford to give away… and I exchanged all that with the Japanese authorities, in the name of the company, for food from the Mainland.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Insisting that underlings refer to him at all times as] Dr Ho.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On share transfers between family] The big problems have all been resolved.  My family and I are very happy on executing plans.  I do not hope to see any further changes.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The recent stir over the Ho family has caused an uproar.  I think it’s time to put an end to this.  Family matters should not involve lawyers, and suing one another in the courts in troublesome!  I also hope the media will not misunderstand.  My health is very good, and there’s no need for anyone to be concerned.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My friendship with Portugal has its roots in Macau, while my love for Portugal resides in both Cascais and Estoril.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I love competition all my life, as long as they are complimentary…
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think now we have two newcomers and we are working side by side, not hard fighting, all complimentary.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ever since this relaxation of individual travellers from mainland China, we are getting excellent business… All three of us, are doing excellent business.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his competitive edge in the casino business in October 2004] We have 40 years of experience and we can claim that so far, we still can maintain the leadership in the market.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his casino] I’ve got this franchise because it was a challenge for me, because I cannot understand why only as 40 miles apart, Hong Kong was so prosperous and Macau was a dying city.  So again I love challenges, I put in a bid and I won the concession.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am in 40 odd years of business and I still don't need to associate with any of the gangs, because for me, I am running a gambling business. In fact, when I first started the Macau people said don't believe Stanley Ho, he is the biggest liar on earth, he can promise you the moon and nothing will happen. But no - I made one promise when I took over, I said the view that my enterprise is one of merely gambling character is a misconception. I promised Macau I will bring you new prosperity, I will try to bring more welfare and better cause of living for your citizens, and I am happy to tell you now, I have fulfilled all my promises.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We have never heard of laundering in Macau…
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In Macau, money laundering is unheard of.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Really, we've never heard of money laundering.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Someone says Stanley Ho, you issue me a check of so much money - we don't give that easy. We will first of all find out, where he won the money, from which table, and then we have this gaming commission in Macau - very strong - they will also join us to check very clearly that this man really made the money in the casino before we issue a check.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The success of Macau is because we have only two democrats…
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When first we heard that Macau and Hong Kong will go back to mainland China, we only dream of talking about immigration, whether we should go to USA, Canada or Australia…
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
When first we heard that Macau and Hong Kong will go back to mainland China, we only dream of talking about immigration, whether we should go to USA, Canada or Australia, and so on, and we have already been very worried that China will redden Hong Kong and Macau, so all we have to do is no more business, we'll all have to hold a red book and talk about Mao Tse-tung thoughts and everyday attend meetings, learning how to fight against one another. So, we never dreamed that we would suddenly have this Deng Xiao-ping who created this new one country two systems, so really we were so surprised when we were told in the end that you can have your capitalist system unchanged for 50 years. Which means there would be enough democracy and freedom. So what's the point of leaving Hong Kong anymore? So as a result most of these people who immigrated abroad, they all came back. And I tell you very frankly, that I am extremely happy with my ways of living in Hong Kong and Macau, it is completely free.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the pro-democracy voice in Macau in October 2004] Quite frankly they are fighting for themselves.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On what the man behind the businessman is really like.] What am I like?… I am very normal.  The only difference is I don’t gamble.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don't gamble at all, all my life. I am only interested in sports.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On whether he was lucky right from the start] Right from the start.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My poor father and my uncles, they were all involved with the Jardine family. So they speculated heavily on Yee Yong shares, they all went broke, they all had to leave Hong Kong, some even committed suicide.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
From riches when I was a young boy of six, seven, eight and then when I got to the age of 13, one night my mother suddenly called me, 'Stanley I am very sorry to give you bad news, I can't afford to even pay your school fees'. So imagine...
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On dealing with his mother not being able to afford to pay his school fees] I didn't sleep the whole night, I wasn't a good boy in school, my marks were very average even in class four in those days, I had to get a conditional pass. But mind you, after that-class three, I was in class 'd' and I managed to get a scholarship every year from then on.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his change from a d class student to one who would get a scholarship every year] I had to study, I had to convert myself into a very hard-working young boy and I got very high marks thereafter.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his family losing everything] I'll give you an idea, when I was eight, my father had a pleasure boat, we had a few motor cars on the road, we had a summer house in Stanley - where I got my name and we were really enjoying so much, we were absolutely spoilt. From that, to imagine - to rags, when even my own family members - I meet them in the street, they would turn away their faces. Really, you have to learn from humility, which is a good lesson for me.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I saw my mother crying everyday going to a pawn shop everyday to keep us going, and I promised her I will make good no matter what. So I managed to bring her from Hong Kong to Macau during the war years, and she lived here happily thereafter.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I became a refugee in Macau during 1941, we had this war in Hong Kong, I fought for the government as an air raid warden for 15 days. Our government surrendered, Hong Kong Government surrendered, so I took a junk and came to Macau in 16 hours and I was a refugee, so that's why I was so much indebted to Macau. I took Macau as a second home, they treated me so well - with 10 dollars in my pocket, I became a millionaire in one year, in one year's time, imagine, during the war years. But I had to work extremely hard. From morning 6 o'clock up to night 10 o'clock when I go to bed, I had absolutely no other enjoyment. So for three years I was like that. So really I believe now, to succeed you must have the spirit of hard working, the enthusiasm, enthusiasm for learning and the spirit of making good your promises.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately the element of luck is minimal. All my life, I never believed in luck, so in my case I could say well maybe five per cent luck. For example, during my first ten years of operation of the casino, I wasn't too successful and then suddenly, all of a sudden, Hong Kong started to issue immigration permits allowing people to come to Macau - so that year, I can say that's luck, really.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think I have received the biggest number of medals from all over the world than anyone in Hong Kong or Macau. But unfortunately, some people still think that Stanley Ho knows too many triads and are connected with the triads. This is very unfair, a real misconception. If I have received even medals from his holiness the pope, you can imagine how much I have done, how much charity, how much help I have given to the church to get such a medal. Not to mention all the others.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I must admit that my life is rather complicated. But just the same I have been treating all my sons and daughters very well. I have done my part, I have given them the best education they can get, I always believe that education is most important. So even for charity I always give priority to education because I always teach young people -- knowledge is your real companion, your life long companion not fortune. Fortune can disappear.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On what he hopes his children can learn from him] I think my elder ones are doing very well, as you have seen. They are helping me and trying to relieve me from too much work - I am a little over worked even now. Because as you understand we have all these new companies from America and I must compete. I want to prove that I will still maintain to be the market leader so let us see.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On whether he had plans to slow down] I really enjoy so much, and not only that the chief executive as expressed more than once, so has mainland China, Stanley Ho, we wish you good health, please carry on for the time being. So no choice - I cannot retire.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I hope to have a long life to start with. So I hope I don't have think about that for the time being. You look at me, I'm quite healthy I play tennis twice a week, I still maintain the veteran open champion in Hong Kong.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At the age of 83] I'm quite healthy I play tennis twice a week, I still maintain the veteran open champion in Hong Kong.
<BR><a href="stanley-ho-quotes.html">Stanley Ho<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his longevity secrets] No secrets at all, I lead a normal life but I must believe that sports has brought me this good health, only sports. I swim everyday and I did a lot of walking, I do a lot of dancing and I hope to be able to dance with you later.
