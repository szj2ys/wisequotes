[On an event costing $15,000, a huge cost compared with the profits they had made at the time.] I decided this event was going to be the making of RedBalloon in the corporate space.  Far from settling on a stand where we could hand out a few brochures, we called up our suppliers and had a rally car, a hot air balloon basket and a number of other real life props to adorn the stand.  We were big, bold and outrageous.  It was a gamble – but we looked big, we were acting as if we were big.  We were living into the future that we dreamed of… Ultimately we won $500,000 worth of business over the next 12 months from the event…

I remember once a woman called RedBalloon wanting to speak to the ‘complaints’ department.  I said ‘Oh we’ve never had a complaint before, but we have had lots of people providing us with a valuable contribution so that we can get even better at what we do.’  It shifted the tone of the conversation immediately.

[In April 2007.] A straight no is always better than no decision at all.
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>

[In April 2007 on the best piece of business advice She ever received.] Run your business as you would live your life, staying true to your personal values.  And above all be you.

[In April 2007.] I have a marketer's brain, not a technical one…
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In April 2007.] You are here to serve your people but unfortunately you can't be all
things to all people.

[In November 2007 with Naomi being aged 43, husband Peter 51, and two children Natalia aged 11 and Oscar aged 9 on originally meeting her husband.] We met at my office in Melbourne in April 1991 and were married on New Year's Eve nine months later. I was working as a marketing manager for Ansett and Peter was working for Westpac in Sydney. My first thought about him was, 'He's full of himself.' But I also thought he was interesting and highly intelligent. He's unflappable and has not one essence of drama in him.  I started the business in 2001. Peter joined in 2002. It was stressful initially. I wanted to have a stand at a corporate gift fair and Peter said to me, 'You've got to be joking. Do you know what our revenue is?' We had an almighty row. The stand was hugely successful. I didn't need to say I told you so. 
<BR><a href="naomi-simson-quotes.html">Naomi Simson<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In November 2007 on being in business with her husband Peter.] The lines are now clearly drawn in our business - I'm creative and marketing and he's accounting and compliance…We have also split responsibilities for the children. I am director of Natalia's school stuff and Peter is director of Oscar's school matters. It makes one person accountable and it works really well when both of us are busy.
