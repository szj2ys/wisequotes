<BR>
[In March 2012 on buying an NFL team.] It is exclusive because you have to be accepted, you have to be able to find the opportunity and you have to be able to afford the opportunity.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2012] I think we can add value by being international.  I think it needs a home team that is committed there for a few years, who can go engage the fans and the community.  It’s also a great way to sell the city globally.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 2011] I will be fully committed to delivering Jacksonville its first Super Bowl championship. This is a franchise with tons of potential, playing in a community that is passionate about football and loves to win. I can't think of a better place to be.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011 on owning an NFL franchise.] Was one thing left on our bucket list and now it is scratched off.  Now we are starting a new bucket list with a Super Bowl championship right on top.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011] Jacksonville in the mid ‘80s was the import truck capital of the world.  It was the No. 1 port for Toyota, Nissan, Isuzu and so on.  If you were in the truck business you had to be here.  I came here and nobody knew me, but we had a lot of success.  We went from supplying nothing to supplying 100 percent for the market.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011] The NFL is going to be developing an international fan base.  Why shouldn’t it be the Jaguars?
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011] I think it would serve Jacksonville well to play a game or two overseas to get the name Jacksonville out there.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011] Our goal would be to keep the spirit and move it up a notch.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011 on the Jacksonville Jaguars.] With this, there is responsibility and there is accountability.  But it is a very exciting time.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011] Running an auto parts business isn’t nearly as sexy.  You don’t get photographed coming out of the washroom…
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011] It gets down to your core values and what you think is important. At a certain point, whatever your life experience is hardwires you. How you approach things and what your mindset is - you get hardwired. You think a certain way. If you have success that thinking pattern gets reinforced. When you don’t, you go back and start making a midcourse correction.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You look at it and you say, ‘Where’s the upside?’ Jacksonville has a great upside.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011 on owning an NFL team.] It’s the biggest day in any American – I’d say, ‘Man,’ but maybe in a woman’s – life. How many people are going to get to do this?
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011] Very few people own 100 percent of an NFL franchise – very few.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011] I have the means to write a check and get it done.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011] I’ve had partners in different businesses. I’d rather not have partners. That way I don’t have accountability to them. It’s mine alone and I would prefer that.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011] My call is to tap into the fans’ desire to have a winner. My calling is to tap in and get them to come to the stadium, fill the stadium, rock and roll in the stadium and put a winner on the field.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2011] I don’t believe religion should come between a man and a Bud Light, OK.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2012] I think there’s no doubt Jacksonville has the best fans in the NFL.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2012] Jacksonville – I’m all in.
<BR><a href="shahid-khan-quotes.html">Shahid Khan<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2012] Only in America.
