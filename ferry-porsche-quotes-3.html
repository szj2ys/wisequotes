<BR>
It’s a basic principle in automotive engineering.  The power-to-weight ratio determines the performance capability of a car.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The design was already on the table, so to speak.  When the design office was developing the Auto-Union race car I participated in every phase.  We had some thoughts which were later reflected in the design of the VW.  For example: The Auto-Union race car had a gas tank with a capacity of as much as 58 gallons located at the centre of gravity of the car.

<BR>
<BR>
We took a normal VW engine and hooked it up to a Roots fan which gave it 45 to 50 hp.  
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I have a car with sufficient surplus power (i.e. a very good power-to-weight ratio) its speed is bound to be high.  Hence, a car with good accelerating power will automatically give me a high speed performance.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We built the Volkswagen with four-wheel drive as a so-called commander’s limousine.  For the VW amphibious car, four-wheel drive was indispensable…

<BR>
[To his father Ferdinand Porsche.] In order to show him my designs.  ‘I wouldn’t have changed a line.’ Was his verdict.  I took it as an acknowledgement that my job was well done.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The form of the 356 originated from my own feel of a car.  There were many elements and past experiences that came together.  I always loved driving cars and owned an Alfa Romeo with Pininfarina body as well as…
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The good after-sales service had primarily been ensured by the fact that we were able to ask Volkswagen dealers worldwide whether they wanted to distribute our car.  
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
This is why the 911 hasn’t been cancelled up to now.  Neither the 928 nor the 924 has been able to overtake the 911.  We are still building two-and-a-half times as many 911s as 928s.

<BR>
<BR>
[On Ettore Bugatti’s son suffering under the dominating personality of his father and whether he has had a similar experience.] Yes, we also experienced the father-son conflict, but I also learned a lot…
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My father and I did a lot of travelling together.  When I was alone with him, he was ready to listen to my critical comments in every respect.  But when other people were present, this was not advisable.  My father was too authoritarian to tolerate critical remarks in the presence of others.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Since the family decided on changing to an outside management, one must expect an outside management to take different views and pursue different intentions.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’ve always tried to give my men a lot of latitude, because I believe that creativity should not be suppressed.  If someone is convinced that the 928 should look like this and not differently, you shouldn’t interfere too much.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My father was very authoritarian and stubborn.  He would work at the drawing board until midnight when he wanted to solve a tricky problem.  For myself, I took this as a lesson that this is not the right approach.  If you spend a lot of time brooding over a problem and cannot come up with a positive result after a certain period of time, I think it is better to relax a little, take a walk or do something similar and then start afresh.  I considered this a good principle, even at the time I was working with my father.

<BR>
<BR>
I think it has always been a philosophy of our company that function and beauty are inseparable.  Beauty as an end in itself is out of place in automobile manufacturing.  If a body styling detail is to be really satisfactory from an aesthetic point of view, it must be functionally justified.  
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In other words: A good Cd-value must exclude unaesthetic features.  
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Always seems to reflect a little bit of the customer’s sense of beauty.  A car should not only be functional, but should also have a beautiful appearance.
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Whoever thought of a heated windshield for the Mercedes-Benz SSK?  Motorcycles are not subject to such extreme regulations.  They can get by with a lot of things that are unthinkable with automobiles.  This is why so many expensive motorcycles are driven by sports car fans – as a compensation!
<BR><a href="ferry-porsche-quotes.html">Ferry Porsche<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1989 on what the car will look like in the year 2000.] The automobile will of course have to become more beneficial to the environment, which also includes noise reduction.  Small cars will be preferred…

The search for a purpose in our lives is universal…

We will keep on striving for perfection.

[On Ferry Porsche] Right up to his death in 1998, my father exerted a decisive influence on the success of the enterprise – first as owner, managing director and head developer, then as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, and later as an experienced advisor.

[On Louise Piech – The sister of Ferry Porsche.] If I had a mother like Louise Piech, I would have become chancellor of Germany. 
<BR><B>Ernst Fuhrmann</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Porsche] If we build too many cars, we will lose our exclusivity and cease being what we are.  And we’re got to be very conscious of that… We can’t build more of what we already have.  Because you get too see too many of them around, and all of a sudden it’s nothing special.
