[On her mother having a choice to give her up for adoption in the hope of a better life for her after her father had passed away] A determination was born in me the day of our visit to Dr Smith that nothing could crush: I must try to take my father’s place in some mysterious way, and prevent anything from breaking up my family.

I would say that the important thing, and I think it is at least 33 1/3 percent important, is to get with the right associates.  I took a cut in salary to be back at the Biograph Studio, and I have always felt that it was a wise move.  When you feel that you are with the right concern, you give a good deal of yourself in order to become valuable to your employers.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I never asked for a raise except when I felt sure that I would get it, and I always got it.  Mr Griffith has often said in talking about those days: ‘Marry was always the last one to leave the studio.’

In my career on the screen, I have seen so many people come into pictures with preconceived ideas that were calculated to revolutionize the industry, and they went out quicker than they came.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A great deal of the adverse criticism and unfavorable advertising that Hollywood and the motion-picture business have had has been in large measure due to the sudden acquisition of a great deal of money on the part of a few person who never had it before.  You cannot spend a large income wisely if you have not saved or handled a small one well.  
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I hated the world, ‘movie,’ and had hated it from the first minute that I saw it in the advertising of the Majestic Company, a rival company to the Biograph with which I worked.  ‘A movie a minute,’ was their slogan.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was not the fact of money alone, it was the principle of the thing that I did not like.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>

<BR>
I am making on only one picture a year.  A company which makes many pictures a year can pay much bigger salaries than I can.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
‘Charlie,’ I would say, ‘We ought to streamline the company and keep with the general trend of the times.’  But there was no moving him.  I don’t think Charlie knew himself what he wanted… It finally came to this: no matter what I proposed, or how I proposed it, Charlie would automatically, without giving the matter any consideration, flatly turn it down.  As we were 50-50 partners, I was completely stymied.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Whenever I do something that seems pretty good, do you know what it is to me?  It is a whip to beat myself with!
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
True, there are occasional accidents of career, but the greatest successes are not accidental; they are designed.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I left the screen because I didn’t want what happened to [Charlie] Chaplin to happen to me… The little girl made me.  I wasn’t waiting for the little girl to kill me.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On describing United Artists in February 1951] Sick unto death.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Arthur Krim and Robert Benjamin buying out Charlie Chaplin’s 25% share of United Artists for $1,113.287.35 in February 1955] God will reward you for adding twenty years to my life.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To United Artists after the Charlie Chaplin buyout] I want the company to declare dividends and to give me a blank cheque for production.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1918] Buy government bonds.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I am a servant of the public.  I’ve never forgotten that.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On getting in to see David Belasco] My life depends on seeing Mr Belasco!
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being asked by David Belasco as a 12 year old ‘You want to become an actress?’] I’m already an actress.  But now I want to become a good one.
<BR><a href="mary-pickford-quotes.html">Mary Pickford<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To me, David Belasco was like the King of England, Julius Caesar and Napoleon all rolled into one.
