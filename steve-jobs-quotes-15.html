We can only do three.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>People get stuck in those patterns, just like grooves in a record, and they never get out of them.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I put Adobe on the map, and they screwed me.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>My primary insight when we were screwed by Adobe in 1999 was that we shouldn’t get into any business where we didn’t control both the hardware and the software, otherwise we’d get our head handed to us.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I first understood this with the camcorder.  Using iMovie makes your camcorder ten times more valuable.  That’s when it hit me that the personal computer was going to morph into something else.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I became even more of a believer in providing end-to-end solutions.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We’re the only company that owns the whole widget – the hardware, the software and the operating system.  We can take full responsibility for the user experience.  We can do things that the other guys can’t do.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>So we spent a lot of time working with the drive manufacturers to get a consumer drive that could burn a DVD.  We were the first to ever ship that.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Here’s the new application.  It’s got one window.  You drag your video into the window.  Then you click the button that says ‘Burn.’  That’s it.  That’s what we’re going to make.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On missing the first CD burners] We kind of missed the boat on that.  So we needed to catch up real fast.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>I felt like a dope.  I thought we had missed it.  We had to work hard to catch up.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On some competitors products] They were so complicated that only a genius could figure out half of their features.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Join the music revolution with iTunes, and make your music devices ten times more valuable.  Rip. Mix. Burn.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It reminds me of my youth.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Don’t worry about Sony.  We know what we’re doing and they don’t.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>If you need slides, it shows you don’t know what you’re talking about.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>That’s it!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Simplify!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Did you think of this?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>In order to make the iPod really easy to us – and this took a lot of arguing on my part – we needed to limit what the device itself would do.  Instead we put that functionality in iTunes on the computer.  For example, we made it so you couldn’t make playlists using the device.  That was controversial.  But what made the Rio and other devices so brain-dead was that they were complicated.  They had to do things like make playlists, because they weren’t integrated with the jukebox software on your computer.  So by owning the iTunes software and the iPod device, that allowed us to make the computer and the device work together, and ti allowed us to put the complexity in the right place.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>We suddenly were looking at one another and saying, ‘This is going to be so cool.’  We knew how cool it was, because we knew how badly we each wanted one personally.  And the concept became so beautifully simple: a thousand songs in your pocket.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Oh, I guess you like this stuff.  It doesn’t show the product.  It doesn’t say what it is.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>There were some skeptics around who asked, ‘How’s this going to actually sell an iPod?’  That’s when it came in handy to be the CEO, so I could push the idea through.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I had this crazy idea that we could sell just as many Macs by advertising the iPod.  In addition, the iPod would position Apple as evoking innovation and youth.  So I moved $75 million of advertising money to the iPod, even though the category didn’t justify one hundredth of that.  That meant that we completely dominated the market for music players.  We outspent everybody by a factor of about a hundred.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I hate that.  It sounds a bit poppy.  It sounds a bit trivial.  Let’s call it off.  Hold on, it’s going to be great.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Hint: It’s not a Mac.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I happen to have one right here in my pocket.  This amazing little device holds a thousand songs, and it goes right in my pocket.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On the iPod] If anybody was ever wondering why Apple is on the earth, I would hold up this as a good example.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>You have your heads up your asses.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>From the earliest days at Apple, I realized that we thrived when we create intellectual property.  If people copied or stole our software, we’d be out of business.  If it weren’t protected, there’d be no incentive for us to make new software or product designs.  If protection of intellectual property begins to disappear, creative companies will disappear or never get started.  But there’s a simpler reason: It’s wrong to steal.  It hurts other people.  And it hurts your own character.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>We believe that 80% of the people stealing stuff don’t want to be, there’s just no legal alternative.  So we said, ‘Let’s create a legal alternative to this.’  Everybody wins.  Music companies win.  The artists win.  Apple wins.  And the user wins, because he gets a better service and doesn’t have to be a thief.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’ve never spent so much of my time trying to convince people to do the right thing for themselves.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We used our small market share to our advantage by arguing that if the store turned out to be destructive it wouldn’t destroy the entire universe.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Piracy and online downloads had already deconstructed the album.  You couldn’t compete with piracy unless you sold the songs individually.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>When I went to Pixar, I became aware of a great divide.  Tech companies don’t understand creativity.  They don’t appreciate intuitive thinking, like the ability of an A&R guy at a music label to listen to a hundred artists and have a feel for which five might be successful.  And they think that creative people just sit around on couches all day and are undisciplined., because they’ve not seen how driven and disciplined the create folks at places like Pixar are.  On the other hand, music companies are completely clueless about technology.  They think they can just go out and hire a few tech folks.  But that would be like Apple trying to hire people to produce music.  We’d get second-rate A&R people, just like the music companies ended up with second-rate tech people.  I’m one of the few people who understands how producing technology requires intuition and creativity, and how producing something artistic takes real discipline.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We know about tech, but we don’t know as much about music, so let’s not argue.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>See how simple it is?  Your tech folks are never going to do this.  There’s no one at the music companies who can make it simple enough.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>With Andy [Lack], it was mostly about his big ego.  He never really understood the music business, and he could never really deliver.  I thought he was sometimes a dick.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>What do you want to search for?  Watch what it can do!  See how the interface works.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[Music on Napster] A lot of these songs are encoded by seven year olds, and they don’t do a great job.  Worst of all it’s stealing.  It’s best not to mess with karma.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-16.html">16<a/> </p><p><BR>
