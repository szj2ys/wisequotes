[On another occasion listening to a brilliant waltz.] I heard that at a fair in Switzerland years ago.  The Swiss women were whirling about in their red petticoats.
<BR><a href="john-jacob-astor-quotes.html">John Jacob Astor<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On standing together with his son William B a short time after the completion of Astor House.] Well, William what do you think of it?  [His son expressed his warm appreciation and admiration of this last achievement of his father’s.]  William, it is yours.  [A few days later the property was turned over to William Backhouse Astor, for ‘One Spanish milled dollar, and love and affection.’]
<BR><a href="john-jacob-astor-quotes.html">John Jacob Astor<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being asked for a contribution to the campaign fund of Henry Clay when he ran for President for a third time.] I am not interested in these things now.  Those gentlemen who are in business, and whose property depends on the issues of the election, ought to give.  I am an old man.  I haven’t anything to do with commerce, and it makes no difference to me what the Government does.  I don’t make money any more.  [‘Why, Mr Astor, you are like Alexander, when he wept because there were no more worlds to conquer.  You have made all the money, and now there is no more money to make.’ – Fundraising committee member.  Then Mr Astor chuckled with amusement and said] Very, good, that’s very good.  Well, I’ll give you something.  [He thereupon drew a check for fifteen hundred dollars, which, though it did not elect his old friend to the Presidency, still stood for a sign of the friendship between them.]
<BR><a href="john-jacob-astor-quotes.html">John Jacob Astor<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On being perhaps the first entrepreneur to diversity and to see] How one form of commerce could be linked with another to the advantage of both.

Ach, mein friend! What was it like, the winter for you, eh?

[On asking Sarah how his first son John Jacob was after the accident.] How is the boy?  [‘Just the same Jacob.’ – Sarah Astor.]

<BR>
<BR>
Dumkopf!
<BR><a href="john-jacob-astor-quotes.html">John Jacob Astor<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On not paying $500 for a ships chronometer but trying to get the ships captain to pay.  Captain subsequently found another ship to captain and due to superior seamanship landed the ship with the tea cargo before Mr Astor’s ship had begun unloading.  Costing him $70,000 due to sudden oversupply.  After that he hired him back for future voyages.] You was right, Cowman.  Seventy thousand dollars I lose for the chronometer.

[On being congratulated by a member of the clergy upon the increased ability to do good which great wealth brought.] Ah, sir, but the disposition to do good does not always increase with the means.

[On Astoria.] This country will see a chain of growing and prosperous cities straight from New York to Astoria, Oregon.

<BR>
<BR>
[To the then president Thomas Jefferson and congress, urging a line of army posts, forty miles apart, from the western extremity of Lake Superior to the Pacific.] These forts or army posts will evolve into cities.  From a fort you get a trading post, and from a trading post you will get a city.
<BR><a href="john-jacob-astor-quotes.html">John Jacob Astor<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On pointing to Thomas Jefferson the site, on his map, of the Falls of St. Anthony.] There you will have a fort some day, for wherever there is water-power, there will grow up mills for grinding grain and sawmills, as well.  This place of power will have to be protected, and so you will have there a post which will eventually be replaced by a city.
<BR><a href="john-jacob-astor-quotes.html">John Jacob Astor<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his loss of $1 million on the Astoria venture, one of his few large losses.] The plan was right, but my men were weak, that is all.  The gateway to China will be from the northwest.  My plans were correct.  Time will vindicate my reasoning.

<BR>
I am not afraid of Jacob; he’ll get through the world.  He has a clear head and every thing right behind the ears.  
<BR><B>Valentine Jeune</B> (Schoolmaster of John Jacob Astor)
<BR>
<BR>
[On Mr Astor.] He began his career, of course, on the narrowest scale; but he brought to the task a persevering industry, a rigid economy, and strict integrity.  To these were added, an inspiring spirit that always looked upward; a genius, bold, fertile and expansive; a sagacity quick to grasp and convert every circumstance to its advantage, and a singular and never-wavering confidence of signal success.  
<BR><B>Washington  Irving</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The spirit which John Jacob Astor showed has been the making of America... The first American promoters, while seeking personal benefit, were moved by considerations of loyalty and patriotism equalled by business men in no other country at any time.  
<BR><B>Arthur Butler Hulbert</B>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><B>Stephen Girard</B>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the ablest boldest and most successful operators that ever lived.  
<BR><B>James Parton</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[Sometime in early the 1840’s.] This old gentleman, with his $15 million, would give it all to have my strength and physical ability… His mind is good, his observations acute, and he seems to know everything that is going on.  But the machinery is all broken up, and there are some people, no doubt, who think he has lived long enough.  <BR><B>Philip Hone</B>
<BR>
<BR>
He added immensely to his riches by purchases of state stocks, bonds, and mortgages in the financial crisis of 1836-37.  He was a willing purchaser of mortgages from needy holders at less than their face [value]; and when they become due, he foreclosed on them, and purchased the mortgaged property at the ruinous prices which ranged at the time. 
<BR><B>New York Herald 31st of March 1848</B>
<BR>
<BR>
A self-invented money-making machine. 
<BR><B>New York Herald 31st of March 1848</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his death in 1848.] For nearly forty years he has been characterized as perhaps the greatest merchant of this if not of any age – the Napoleon of commerce. 
<BR><B>Hunt’s Merchant Magazine</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his death in 1848.] In the art of prospering in business, he has had no equal.  To get all that he could and to keep nearly all that he got – those were the laws of his being.
<BR><B>Harper’s Magazine</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[On coming on deck after the Titanic hit an iceberg, later going down with the ship.] I asked for ice, but this is ridiculous.
