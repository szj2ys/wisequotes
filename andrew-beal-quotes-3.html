<BR>
[In May 1999] Please, please, please, structure whatever you do so that only success is rewarded and so that anyone that achieves that success is equally rewarded. The government should not reward fancy ideas, glossy brochures, and unsuccessful effort as it has in past aerospace programs. 
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 1999] We don't mind the risks…
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2000] Beal Aerospace regrets to announce that it is ceasing all business operations effective October 23, 2000.
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2000] Beal Aerospace has made significant advances in low cost hydrogen peroxide propulsion systems and continues to believe that low cost and reliable space launch systems are viable and producible by relatively small commercial companies. Despite our experience with cost overruns and schedule delays, we were confident of our ability to ultimately succeed in the development of our BA-2C rocket launch system.
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2000] Development of a reliable low cost system is simply not enough to insure commercial viability. Several uncertainties remain that are totally beyond our control and put our entire business at risk. The most insurmountable risk is the desire of the U.S. government and NASA to subsidize competing launch systems.
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2000] NASA has embarked on a plan to develop a “second generation” launch system that will be subsidized by U.S. taxpayers and that will compete directly with the private sector. In my capacity as founder and chairman of Beal Aerospace, I previously testified to a congressional subcommittee that government subsidies to competing launch providers constituted the private sectors biggest business risk. Nonetheless, NASA remains committed to such an effort…
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2000] While Beal Aerospace recognizes the need for NASA to develop a human rated launch capability for space station and other human missions, we find it inexcusable and intolerable that NASA intends for these subsidized systems to additionally compete for non-human rated missions including cargo for the space station and commercial satellite missions.  
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2000] We would have remained in business if the government would have simply guaranteed that NASA’s subsidized launch systems would never be allowed to compete with the private sector.  
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2000] There will never be a private launch industry as long as NASA and the U.S. government choose and subsidize launch systems.  While Boeing and Lockheed  are private entities, their launch systems and components are derivatives of various military initiatives. Very little new effort takes place without significant government subsidy, control, and involvement.
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2000] Once it became clear that NASA and Congress intended to proceed with their new competing launch systems, our only remaining choice was whether to cease operations entirely, or to evolve into a government contractor role like Boeing and Lockheed and seek government contracts to assist the development of the NASA system. We have elected to cease operations.
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2001] It is unfortunate that I continue to read ill-informed comments about the reasons for our demise.  The real damage from these commentaries is that they mask the real issues and instill a sense that only NASA and DOD funded efforts can succeed.  Our program would have resulted in a well-conceived, technically absolutely achievable, large lower cost launch vehicle.
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2001] We were naively lured into business by NASA’s constant remarks about wanting to encourage privatization and new launch service providers.
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2001] NASA has apparently fooled Congress into thinking that significant new technology must be developed by the government funded aerospace community to achieve reliable low cost access to space.  Congress responded with a $10 billion projected program for the next 10 years.  The fact is that no new technology is required.
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2001] NASA’s real goal is the subsidized development of a space shuttle replacement that will be privately operated and available for commercial use (read direct competition for any launch service provider).  While this may be a worthy goal, it kills the prospects for start ups like Beal Aerospace.
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2001] We suggested NASA and Congress make a commitment not to compete with efforts like ours.
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2001] Let’s all be thankful that Congress didn’t fund NASA to develop low cost personal computers to compete with Dell and Compaq and new low cost operating software to compete with Microsoft.  With enough money, NASA will always succeed.  The consequence of NASA’s success would be that Microsoft and ‘Windows’ would not exist and some clunky NASA software package written by IBM would be the industry standard.
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2001] I was appalled that former NASA engineer Dennis Tito had to pay a foreign country to access the ISS.  Let’s all be thankful that Congress never funded NASA to develop the automobile.  
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2001] Assertions that we closed our doors because of technical challenges or diminished demand are absurd.  The fact is, there is plenty of business for a reliable low cost system.  Low efficiency (but low cost) rockets are relatively easy to build and we would have demonstrated that.
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2001] NASA has changed the evolutionary process for new companies and tilted the playing field against private efforts.  As a result there is no role for new launch service companies except as commodity subcontractors to NASA and its primes. 
<BR><a href="andrew-beal-quotes.html">Andrew Beal<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2005 on <a href="elon-musk-quotes.html">Elon Musk<a/>’s efforts and SpaceX] They absolutely can be successful, but the biggest risk is government.  My advice is to be careful.

If great deals aren’t available, I simply won’t do any.

<BR>
Bonus
<BR>
<BR>
[On Andrew Beal] He has 20/20 vision into what is going to happen in the future.  I know lots of smart bankers. Andy is right at the top of the list. 
<BR><a href="donald-trump-quotes.html">Donald Trump<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Andrew Beal] He has an incredible ability to quickly cut to the chase and see and analyze the key components of any deal.  
<BR><B>Steve Houghton</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
[On Andrew Beal] The consummate contrarian. 
<BR><B>Steve Houghton</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
[On Andrew Beal buying defaulted loans at bargain basement prices.] He cherry-picked and bought the good assets and bought them at the lowest price.  It was brilliant.  
<BR><B>Brad Oates</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Andrew Beal] He's got a brilliant, quick mind, but he's down to earth. 
<BR><B>Brad Oates</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Andrew Beal] He puts his risk capital to work to create something. That's a big difference in some other people's wealth mentality.  It's not about him living in the palace of Versailles; it's about him creating something of lasting value... He puts up his own venture capital and doesn't expect a hand up. 
<BR><B>Brad Oates</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Andrew Beal and Beal Aerospace.] He was competing against the federal government, and they are very hard to compete against.  
<BR><B>Paul Nisbet</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Andrew Beal] I never felt like he was a millionaire.  I mean, he flies economy. 
<BR><B>Michael Carden</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The government should be pushing new technologies while the Andy Beals of the world commercialize it within the best business model. 
<BR><B>Brad Oates</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2001 on Andrew Beal] I admire him for going to the frontiers and not being afraid to go outside the comfort zone.  He'll never stop. He'll never retire... He represents the best that American entrepreneurism has to offer. 
<BR><B>Brad Oates</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2000 on Andrew Beal buying the former FINA headquarters.] It's great real estate, a great location.  If you put the land with the building, you couldn't replicate it for less than what you could buy it for. 
<BR><B>Bill Cawley</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
[On Andrew Beal’s ability to play poker.] I always thought of myself as a good player.  But I'm not in his league.
