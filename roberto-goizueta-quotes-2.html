[In 1996 at the age of 65 on continual learning] I am proud to say that I learned more in 1995 than any year before, but not as much as I will this year [1996].

<BR>
<BR>
Our behavior will produce leaders, good managers, and – most importantly – entrepreneurs.  It is my desire that we take initiatives as opposed to being only reactive and that we encourage intelligent individual risk-taking.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the fall of the former soviet union] The collapse was driven by that government’s insistence on running businesses and other functions of society that should have remained outside the domain of government.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Think about it.  If a company wanted merely to create shareowner value right now, its leaders could suddenly make hundreds of decisions that would deliver a staggering short-term windfall.  They could gouge their customers and suppliers.  They could stop investing in their brands or stop behaving like good corporate citizens.  They could slash salaries and benefits.  They could put their business up for auction to the highest bidder.  But that type of behavior has nothing to do with sustaining value creation over time.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In the 1980s on Cokes enemy not being Pepsi, but being coffee, milk, tea and water] What’s our market share of the stomach?
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his school days] I could memorize whole pages of history books.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can think through a problem so hard, you can develop a sweat.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One’s personal commitments are much more important than the truth or falsehood of one’s position.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is a good sign that human beings almost always act in their own interest.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the New Coke] The best just got better.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On speeches] I am also reminded of my wife’s frequent observation that no one ever comes away from listening to a speech saying, ‘That was great… but I wish it had been longer.’  So, in acknowledgement of the… insightfulness of Mrs. Goizueta – my message to you will be brief and to the point.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the United States] I must start by recognizing the vision and determination of those of you who are to be naturalized today as citizen of this great country… It is your vision of a better place that has brought you to this place today.  And it is your decisiveness… as the masters of your own destiny… that has made this moment a reality.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On immigrating to the United States] We share a truly magical gift… the magical gift of freedom… and with it, its corollary we refer to as ‘opportunity.’
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On immigrating from Cuba to the United States] When my family and I came to this country, we had to leave everything behind.  Back in Havana, our family photographs hung on the walls.  Our wedding gifts sat on the shelves.  Every material property we owned… overnight became government property.  But amid that turmoil, two treasured possessions remained mine because they simply could not be taken away by the newly arrived Cuban rulers.  Firstly, even though I had to leave behind my diploma from Yale… I still had my education.  And secondly… I still had a job.  And it wasn’t just any job.  It was a job with The Coca-Cola Company.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being an immigrant who went on the lead The Coca-Cola Company] My story - boils down to a single, inspiring reality… the reality that a young immigrant could come to this country, be given a chance to work hard and apply his skills, and ultimately earn the opportunity to lead not only a large corporation, but an institution that actually symbolizes the very essence of America and American ideals.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Opportunity always comes accompanies by obligations.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In my life, I have found that every opportunity I have ever encountered has implied three fundamental obligations.  The first obligation implied in opportunity is that you must seize it… You must reach out to the opportunity… take it in your hands… and mold it into a work that brings value to your society.  The second obligation that naturally follows opportunity is that you must live it… you must carry it on your back all day long… you must sense the opportunity in your nostrils with every breath, and you must see it in your dreams when you are asleep… Finally, the third obligation that inherently comes with opportunity is that you must defend it.  
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Squandering what the rest of the world covets is not only foolish… it is immoral.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Without action, opportunity and freedom soon shrivel and fade to a slow death.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Opportunity… ours to seize… ours to live… and ours to defend.  Or otherwise – ultimately – ours to lose.

<BR>
<BR>
I consider my biggest task not to get ahead of others but to surpass myself, and to make the ideal in my mind become a reality in my everyday life of work for the Company [Coca-Cola].
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Coca-Cola advertising] I don’t care if they like the people, I don’t care if they like the cast we use.  At the end of the day, the consumer has to say, ‘I want to go out and buy a Coke.’
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To a key financial executive] I don’t want you to be a yes man.  I don’t object that you fight with me.  I don’t object that you shout at me, but always with the door 
closed.  You and me alone.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>

<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t even come to us with a project that doesn’t yield more money than the cost of money.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There’s a perception… that you’re better off if you’re in two lousy businesses than if you’re in one good one – that you’re spreading your risk.  It’s crazy.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
[On going into Eastern Germany] We’re got to move quickly.  We don’t need to put a Coke sign up in front of all the plants, but it’s essential to be flexible and be in first.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Russia never knew capitalism.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Pepsi’s strategy of investing in snack foods and restaurants] They tend to think with their mouths open and they don’t always do what they say… It’s wonderful to have a good competitor.  But I just hope they don’t get too distracted with potato chips.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Pepsi has made a huge mistake calling it Pepsi Clear.  I doubt there is a clear cola category, and we don’t want to put the Coke name on it.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To be successful, we’ve got to make it impossible for the consumer to escape The Coca-Cola Company.
<BR><a href="roberto-goizueta-quotes.html">Roberto Goizueta<a/>
