Are not his promises wide enough?<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> I would advise you never to name my European trip to me unless you are blest with a super abundance of patience, as its very mention is calculated to bring up with it an almost inexhaustible assemblage of grand and beautiful associations.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Passing over the works of the creator, which are far the most impressive, it is difficult to conceive of the influences which even the works of his creatures exercise over the mind of one who lingers amidst their master productions.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Take from me my liberty, take what you will, but leave me my statuary, leave me these entrancing productions of art.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> I shall never be content until I am at the head of an establishment in which my friends can feel at home in Lexington.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> [I had] long cultivated the habit of connecting the most trivial and customary acts of life with a silent prayer.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Why, in the name of reason do you walk a mile in the rain for a perfectly unimportant thing?  Simply because I have discovered that it was a misstatement, and I could not sleep comfortably unless I put it right.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Ah!  That is not the way to be happy.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> It seems to me, that if they would unite thus in prayer, war might be prevented and peace preserved.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> The time may come when your state will need your services, and if that time does come; then draw your  swords and throw away the scabbards.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>All I am and all I have is at the service of my country.If I know myself, all I am and all I have is at the service of my country.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> An ever kind providence has given me the post which I prefer above all others.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> [On being asked how many men he had in his garrison] I should be glad if Lincoln thought I had fifteen thousand.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> What do you want with military news?  Don’t you know that it is unmilitary and unlike an officer to write news respecting one’s past?<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> [To General Robert E. Lee asking for help regarding heavy cannons in defence of high points] I would be more than gratified, could you spare the time for a short visit here, to give me the benefit of your wisdom and experience in laying out the different works, especially those on the heights.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> I am of the opinion that this place should be defended with the spirit which actuated the defenders of Thermopylae, and if left to myself, such is my determination.  The fall of this place would I fear, result in the loss of the northwestern part of the state [West Virginia], and who can estimate the moral power thus gained to the enemy and lost to ourselves?<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> I want my brigade to feel that it can whip Patterson’s whole army and I believe we can do it.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Steady, men!  Steady!  All’s well!<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> [On being told he was wounded] Only a scratch – a mere scratch.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR>  [On being told ‘General, the day is going against us’] If you think so, sir, you had better not say anything about it.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Reserve your fire till they come within fifty yards, then fire and give them the bayonet; and when you charge, yell like furies.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Give me 10,000 fresh troops, and I would be in Washington tomorrow.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Yesterday we fought a great battle and gained a great victory, for which all the glory is due to God alone… The battle was the hardest that I have ever been in, but not nears so hot in it’s fire.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Let others speak praise, not myself.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Truth is mighty and will prevail.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> [On being asked ‘General how is it that you can keep so cool, and appear so utterly insensible to danger in such a storm of shells and bullets as rained about you when your hand was hit?’] Captain, my religious belief teaches me to feel as safe in battle as in bed.  God has fixed the time for my death.  I do not concern myself about that, but to be always ready, no matter when it may overtake me.  That is the way all men should live and then all would be equally brave.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Every officer and soldier, who is able to do duty, ought to be busily engaged in military preparation by hard drilling in order that through the blessing of God, we may be victorious in the battles, which in his all-wise providence may await us.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> If the war is carried out with vigor, I thin that, under the blessing of God, it will not last long.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> I never found anything impossible with this brigade!<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Sacrifices!  Have I not made them?  What is my life here but a daily sacrifice?  Nor shall I ever withhold sacrifices for my country when they will avail to anything. I intend to serve here, anywhere in any way I can, even if it be as a private solider.  But if this method of making war is to prevail, the country is ruined.<BR><BR><BR><BR>We spent as happy a winter, as ever falls to the lot of mortals upon earth.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> [On Brigadier General Barnard Bee telling him that his forces were beingbeaten back] Sir, we will give them the bayonet.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> The inheritance which is incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> We all carry the memory of wounds we have suffered through our lives. The love we receive and the values instilled at an early age, combined with God’s healing power will determine how ugly and visible the scars that remain and how we allow them to define our character.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Be not discouraged by disappointments & difficulties but on the contrary let each stimulate you to greater exertions for attaining noble ends & an approving conscience at least will be your reward.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> I then learned an important lesson: that one who has been the subject of converting grace and is the child of God can, in the midst of the severest sufferings, fix his thoughts upon God and heavenly things, and derive great comfort and peace; but that one who had never made his peace with God would be unable to control his mind, under such sufferings, so as to understand properly the way of salvation, and repent and believe on Christ.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> A most personal and valuable lesson. Do not give into your fears of public prayer and speaking. Allow God to give you the voice and confidence to honor him.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> It is a great comfort to me to know that although I am not with you, yet you are in the hands of One who will not permit any evil to come nigh you. What a consoling thought it is to know that we may, with perfect confidence, commit all our friends in Jesus to the care of our Heavenly Father, with an assurance that all will be well with them!<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Unconditional faith and complete trust in the Lord conquers all vices, blesses us with joy and happiness where only darkness once appeared, and gives strength and courage in times of adversity.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> Sir, we’ll give them the bayonet then.<BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">Stonewall Jackson<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="stonewall-jackson-quotes-3.html">3<a/> </p><p><BR>
