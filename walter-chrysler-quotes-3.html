I think I never hired a man away from Buick… many of them came to see me and asked for jobs.

The Willys-Overland Corporation had saddled itself with an airplane plant, with a harvester company and with other subsidiaries, almost none of which were doing it any good. But its harvesters and airplanes, if anything, were rather better than its automobiles. The company had to make better automobiles if it was to survive… What could be made by Willys that would sell?

<BR>
<BR>
Right after the war all automobile companies had experienced a boom market. Customers asked salesmen only one tough question, ‘Can you make delivery?’
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On selling cars right after World War I] If you could deliver automobiles you could sell them.
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What had appeared to be a flourishing boom ended in a depression, the postwar collapse…

<BR>
<BR>
I had put a price of $995 on the redesigned car; that showed a profit of only $5… I'm liquidating an inventory.

<BR>
<BR>
No more big opportunities in this country? There never were so many opportunities for young men in the history of the world. If you miss one chance, that is no reason for brooding; there will be another if you keep alert and qualify yourself for opportunities.
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was in the enterprise with all my heart and soul. It was already determined that the new car on which our hopes were founded would be called the Chrysler…
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We could not sell Chrysler cars unless we made them.

<BR>
<BR>
[On having a display in the hotel lobby in 1924 when not permitted by the American Automobile Chamber of Commerce to display models of cars which had not yet been produced and sold when Maxwell Motor Corporation had problems when Walter had come along] Although we were not in the show, we stole it! From morning until late at night a crowd was densely packed around us…

<BR>
[In 1924] ‘Seventy miles an hour? Is that on the level, Walt?’ There were shrewd brains behind some of the eyes that were looking our new six over…
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There was no question about space for the Chrysler sixes when the allotments were made for the Automobile Show of 1925. In one year we had sold 32,000 of them…
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The result for that year, which we began by creating a debt of $5,000,000, was a net profit of $4,115,000. It was a good time to straighten out our corporation structure and so, in 1925, the Maxwell Motor Corporation became the Chrysler Corporation.

<BR>
<BR>
The Chrysler Corporation as of 1937 has no debts.
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Expenses of the Chrysler Corporation had to be cut during 1931, 1932 and 1933. We had to cut salaries, reduce operations, retrench in almost every way. There were bleak months when the plants, for lack of orders, were operating down to forty per cent of capacity. But no matter how gloomy the outlook, I never cut one single penny from the budget of our research department.

<BR>
<BR>
Something that any modern industrialist knows and understands. Its research work is what will be keeping any soundly managed industry alive and healthy five and ten years in the future. As the depression became worse, as people became more gloomy, we grew bolder in our research. The things that were developed in the laboratories in those dark days are the improvements that created a strong demand for cars in 1936 and 1937. Research is the answer, if anyone should ask why modern cars are so much improved; it is why the automobiles of the future will be incomparably better than any we have seen.

<BR>
<BR>
Ancestors? I got millions of 'em!
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Any great industrial corporation lives and grows only through the devoted services of many who pool their intelligence and energy in a common effort.
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is no way for men to qualify themselves for what we do at that table except by work and learning.
<BR><a href="walter-chrysler-quotes.html">Walter Chrysler<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is more to industry than money and machines. There are men.

[On Chrysler being a team not just an individual effort] No matter how proud I feel because it bears the name of Chrysler, I never fool myself that I did all this.
