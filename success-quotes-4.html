<BR>
<BR>
The success of one person depends on the success of others.
<BR><B>John Rockefeller</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Nothing succeeds like success.
<BR><B>English proverb</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Anyone who has attained success is regularly asked the same question y people he or she meets: ‘How can I, or anyone else, do it too?’ When I tell them how I started out creating the base for my own business, as a drilling operator four decades ago, they usually reply: ‘But you were lucky, you started your business at a time when it was still possible to make millions, you couldn’t do it again today.  Nobody could.’
I cannot help but be perplexed by this negative, and I think erroneouse attitude, proffered by otherwise intelligent people.  Assuredly, there exists a mass of facts which prove that young, dynamic, imaginative and hustling people have more opportunity to attain wealth and success today than ever before in our history.  Innumerable young businessmen, aware and aggressive, have shown this to be true over the last few years by making a fortune in a variety of ways.
<BR><B>John Paul Getty</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The first suggestion consists of placing the idea and the world ‘God’ in the mind, and of positively knowing that all success stems from Him.  Then adjust this idea of success with the thought ‘God, I Am Success’.  Then comes the following thought: ‘God, I am completely capable of succeeding in any effort that I sincerely undertake’.  And next: ‘God, I am that infinite love which will attract all those elements essential to my success’.
<BR><B>Baird T Spalding</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Most people know what ingredients are necessary for success.  The only problem is that they are not ready to pay the price.
<BR><B>Rich Port</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Success is the result of unrelenting labour.
<BR><B>Paul Ricard</B>
<BR>
<BR>
A man has succeeded when he wakes up in the morning, goes to bed at night, and does what he likes between the two.
<BR><B>Bob Dylan</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The art of being very audacious and very careful at the same time is the art of success.
<BR><B>Napoleon Bonaparte</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I am always astonished to see so many talented people fall in one way or another during their lives.  People fail to achieve what they planned to do, or if they do achieve something, alas, they are too often shot down by the outrageous slings of bad fortune.  Despite the fact that luck certainly plays a role in success or failure, I am convinced that there are no secrets for success.  People usually fail because of their own mistakes.  If someone seems to progress without error, others ascribe it to some kind of genius.  Success depends more on common sense than on genius.
<BR><B>An Wang</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Basically, when you get to my age, you’ll really measure your success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you. I know people who have a lot of money, and they get testimonial dinners and they get hospital wings named after them. But the truth is that nobody in the world loves them. If you get to my age in life and nobody thinks well of you, I don’t care how big your bank account is, your life is a disaster. That’s the ultimate test of how you have lived your life. The trouble with love is that you can’t buy it. You can buy sex. You can buy testimonial dinners. You can buy pamphlets that say how wonderful you are. But the only way to get love is to be loveable. It’s very irritating if you have a lot of money. You’d like to think you could write a check: I’ll buy a million dollars of love. But it doesn’t work that way. The more you give love away, the more you get.
