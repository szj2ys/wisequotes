Only in this country could an immigrant boy, who didn’t speak the language, have opportunities like this.

<BR>
<BR>
I can see that the main reason I succeeded was because I sold, not automobiles, but service.
<BR><a href="john-hertz-quotes.html">John Hertz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On providing excellent service] The result was that my customers sold most of my cars for me.

<BR>
<BR>
[On the stock market and a company’s share price.] The best thing to do is to attend strictly to taking care of business and to leave the stock to take care of itself.  
<BR><a href="john-hertz-quotes.html">John Hertz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On net profit sharing with his Yellow Cab drivers.] Bankers told me when I started out to do this that I was a wild-eyed radical.

<BR>
[In January 1925 on having immigrated to the United States and succeeding.] I came here as a foreigner, and this country not only tolerated but encouraged me.  It will do the same for every other immigrant who is willing to work to succeed.

The best thing that ever happened to me was that my father went broke… and decided to make a new start in this country.

[In June 1926 on some of the beginnings of Hertz Rent-a-car.] About two years ago I became convinced that there was a real public demand for and a real public service to be rendered by the establishment of a chain of operating companies throughout the United States which would be engaged in the business of renting high grade private automobiles without drivers on a mileage basis.  At that time there were already a large number of local concerns doing this class of business.  I found, however, that it was being conducted in a more or less haphazard fashion, curiously resembling the taxicab business in its early stages and unfortunately in disrepute.  
<BR><a href="john-hertz-quotes.html">John Hertz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 1926 on more of the beginnings of Hertz Rent-a-car.] Sometime thereafter we organized the Hertz Drivurself System, a corporation capitalized at $1,000,000, all of the stock being owned by the Yellow Truck & Coach Manufacturing Co.  The object of this system was to license independent companies throughout the United States, and many of these companies are today operating under the name ‘Yellow Drivurself System.’  Within fifteen months we established in various cities approximately 300 stations engaged in the business of renting automobiles without drivers on a mileage basis.  We now have about 6500 of these automobiles in service and have been entirely unable to keep pace with the demand.

<BR><a href="john-hertz-quotes.html">John Hertz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I analyzed my assets and my qualifications, and concluded that I had nothing but my wide acquaintanceship in the sporting world.  I had won several amateur boxing tournaments at the Chicago Athletic Association and I could see no course open to me except to become manager of some prize fighter.  This I did.  I was making fairly good money and was getting a lot of experience, but my girl vowed that she would not marry me until I gave up this kind of life.  As I simply could not think of living long without her, I began looking around for other work.

[In November 1933] I’m not a financier.  I’m not a banker.  I’m just an operator.

[On being a boxing manager in his early days.] Perhaps if I had not become the manager of Benny Yanger I might now be a struggling newspaper writer.

Managers of boxers have to exercise as much acumen if they wish to make successful business deals for their charges as do business men…

We have been operating at a loss, and I'm telling you confidentially that we can't go any further unless we can get an increase in rates to stay in effect until such time as our cabs can get passengers on their return trips.
<BR><a href="john-hertz-quotes.html">John Hertz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If the City Council does not enact an ordinance to allow us to make a fair increase in our rates, we are through, and Chicago will again be without a taxicab service.

I knew a chauffeur who was acting as a demonstrator for an automobile agency and he felt that I should be able to capitalize my friendship with patrons of sport and others by becoming an automobile salesman.  I got a start, but although I worked tremendously hard, I made only $800 the first year, not enough to keep us – yes I got married.  But the second year I made $12,000, and the next year I sold more than the manager and seven or eight salesmen combined.  I earned $13,500 this third year.

[On moving from making $800/year to $13,500 in his third year] I was determined that my wife’s folks should not be in a position to point their finger at us.  This fired me with ambition…

If one of my customers had a breakdown at 2 o’clock in the morning he knew that all he had to do was to telephone me and that I would be on my way to help him out – cars broke down rather often in those days.  I bought supplies for them at cost and did everything I could for them.  The result was that my customers sold most of my cars for me.
<BR><a href="john-hertz-quotes.html">John Hertz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the foundations of the Yellow Taxis business] As my customers weren’t buyers of second-hand cars, I had to put on my thinking cap to find some way of disposing them or making them earn their keep.
<BR><a href="john-hertz-quotes.html">John Hertz<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Having driven a delivery wagon, I figured that there should be money in the passenger delivery business.  Joy-riding was beginning to become popular.  Families were taking to hiring a car for outings, especially on Sundays.  And a few taxis were beginning to make their appearance…
<BR><a href="john-hertz-quotes.html">John Hertz<a/>

[On setting up the Yellow Taxis business and expanding it] I feel as if I had started a treadmill going and that I must keep on going and going…

The Yellow Cab Company wants to be your father, mother, uncle, aunt, and best friend.  Nothing can happen to you that is not our concern.  We have the money and the means to do for you things your father and mother would like to do but can’t.  You simply go out and treat every customer as if he or she was the last customer you had and you couldn’t live without him or her.  Do this and you can look upon us as your home.  Nobody can put you out of this home without your having the opportunity to lay your case before the general manager.

I knew something about the taxicab business, but I knew nothing about the ways of Wall Street.  I have now reached the conclusion, however, that the best thing to do is to attend strictly to taking care of business and to leave the stock to take care of itself.  That is what I am now doing.
