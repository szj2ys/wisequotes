While it’s nice and often helpful to have a rising market, it’s not required.  Because your bargain opportunities are created by special corporate events – events that take place in all market environments – new bargains are constantly being created.

It might not be today or tomorrow, but if you do your homework well, the stock market will eventually recognise the inherent value that attracted you to the bargain opportunity in the first place.  That’s why, in the end, a disciplined approach to seeking out bargain stocks will pay off.
