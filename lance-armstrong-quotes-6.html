I knew that I was going to be cured, that was the way it would go, with a big surging attack, just like in a race.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Cancer picked the wrong guy.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I wanted to tear the legs off cancer, the way I tore the legs off other riders on a hill.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>When it [cancer] looked around for a body to hand out in, it made a big mistake when it chose mine.  Big mistake.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>All of a sudden, a figure moved up on my left.  It was a woman in her 50s on a heavy mountain bike, and she went right by me.  I couldn’t keep up with her.  I had to admit I was in bad shape.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I can still do this, I told myself.  I might not be able to do it like I used to, but I can still do it.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>In the midst of chemo, my licence had expired.  I could have put off renewing it until I felt better and had grown some hair back, but I decided not to.  I wanted this picture so that when I got better, I would never forget how sick I’ve been.  You have to fight.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Cancer could be an opportunity as well as a responsibility.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Fight like hell, just like I did.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>I wanted to be cured, and cured now.  I didn’t want to wait a year to find out.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Love and cancer were strange companions, but in my case they came along at the same time.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I didn’t have cancer anymore, but I didn’t not have it, either.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was a cancer survivor first and an athlete second.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Too many athletes live as though the problems of the world don’t concern them.  We are isolated by our wealth and narrow focus, and our elitism.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>One of the redeeming things about being an athlete – one of the real services we can perform – is to redefine what’s humanly possible.  We cause people to reconsider their limits, to see what looks like a wall may really just be an obstacle in the mind.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I counted and recounted my financial assets and sweated every mortgage payment, wondering if I would ever make another dime from cycling.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>In an odd way, having cancer was easier than recover – at least in chemo I was doing something, instead of just waiting for it to come back.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was still struggling to get past the idea that I could have lost my life, and it was difficult to know where to begin again.  <BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I didn’t know what I wanted, or even what was possible, I couldn’t help feeling that cycling was trivial.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Cancer does one of two things to a relationship: it either brings you closer together, or it tears you apart.  <BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I had missed most of my 20s.  I was to busy being a pro athlete and making a living from the age of 15 on to do the things most people in their 20s do….<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Carpe diem, I told myself, seize the day.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>While I was being treat I was actively killing the cancer, but when the treatment stopped, I felt powerless, like I wasn’t doing anything but waiting for the other shoe to fall.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was [afraid].  I had been strong as a bull on the bike, and what if I wasn’t anymore?  Or what if racing could make me sick again?<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I made my mind up: I would try to race again.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I don’t feel like damaged goods.  I just feel out of shape, which I am.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was now officially a cancer survivor.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>How do you survive cancer?  That’s the part no one gives you any advice on.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was physically recovered, but my soul was still healing.  I was entering a phase called survivorship.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Things change, intentions get lost.  You have another beer.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>If I had a bad day, I had a tendency to say, ‘Well, I’ve just been through too much.  I’ve been through three surgeries, three months of chemo, and a year of hell, and that’s the reading I’m not riding well.  My body is just never going to be the same.’  But what I really should have been saying was, ‘Hey, it’s just a bad day.’<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was making a fraction of my old salary, and I had no new endorsements.  I … called it ‘an eighty percent cancer tax.’<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> [I] thought about how much I didn’t want to be there.  When you start out thinking that way, things can’t possibly get any better.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>This is not how I want to spend my life, freezing and soaked and in the gutter.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was a bum.  I played golf every day, I water skied, I drank beer, and I lay on the sofa and channel-surfed.  But it wasn’t fun.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I’d been given a second chance and I was determined to take advantage of it.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I hated the bike, but I thought, What else am I going to do?  Be a coffee boy in an office?<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was just being a bum.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Golf wasn’t the issue.  The issue was finding myself again.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-9.html">9<a/> </p><p><BR>
