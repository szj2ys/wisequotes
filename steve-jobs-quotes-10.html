But a typewriter is antiquated.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[In Ralph Lauren’s Polo Shop] There’s a beautiful red dress there that would be perfect for you.  You ought to buy it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I thought I was in love with her [Joan Baez], but I really just liked her a lot.  We weren’t destined to be together.  I wanted kids, and she didn’t want any more.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To his mother on her deathbed] When you and Dad got married, were you a virgin?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[Doctor who’s name was on his birth certificate.] He was in the phone book, so I gave him a call.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On his adopted parents] I never wanted them to feel like I didn’t consider them my parent’s, because they were totally my parents.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I loved them [His adopted parents] so much that I never wanted them to know of my search, and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them out.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I believe in environment more than heredity in determining your traits, but still you have to winder a little about your biological roots.  I wanted to meet my biological mother mostly to see if she was okay and to thank her, because I’m glad I didn’t end up as an abortion.  She was twenty-three and she went through a lot to have me.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>My sister’s a writer!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Mona [His sister] was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me.  As we got to know each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family.  I don’t know what I’d do without her.  I can’t imagine a better sister.  My adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>I still remember those first suits I sent Mona [His sister].  They were linen pants and tops in a pale grayish green that looked beautiful with her reddish hair.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On no wanting to meet his biological father] He didn’t treat me well.  I don’t hold anything against him – I’m happy to be alive.  But what bothers me most is that he didn’t treat Mona [His sister] well.  He abandoned her.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On learning who his biological father was] It was amazing.  I had been to that restaurant a few times, and I remember meeting the owner.  He was Syrian.  Balding.  We shook hands.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn’t trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it.  I asked Mona not to tell him about me.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Syria] I don’t think anybody really knows what we should be doing over there.  You’re f*cked if you do and you’re f*cked if you don’t.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To his biological mother] Don’t worry.  I had a great childhood.  I turned out okay.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I didn’t want to be a father, so I wasn’t.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On visiting Lisa] I probably didn’t go over there enough.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Tina Redse] She was the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen.  She was the first person I was truly in love with.  We had a deep connection.  I don’t know that anyone will ever understand me better than she did.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I am a reflection of what I do.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>What could I do?  I’ve made myself unemployable.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Tina Redse] She was one of the purest people I’ve ever known.  There was something spiritual about here and spiritual about the connection we had.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Laurene Powell future wife] I looked to my right, and there was a beautiful girl there, so we started chatting while I was waiting to be introduced.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Excuse me, wasn’t there something about a raffle you won, that I’m supposed to take you to dinner? <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>How about dinner tonight?  We’ve been together ever since.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>There were only two women in my life that I was truly in love with, Tina and Laurene.  I thought I was in love with Joan Baez, but I really just liked her a lot.  It was just Tina and Laurene.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[Standing in the drizzling rain holding wildflowers] May I come in and see Laurene?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Kat, can you come here for a minute?  As you know, Laurene’s father passed away, and Laurene’s mother isn’t here, and since you’re her best friend, I’m going to ask you the question.  I’d like to marry Laurene.  Will you give your blessing?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We know exactly were it happened.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I don’t want to eat here.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Get rid of her.  I can’t look at her stuff.  It’s sh*t.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>You see, Mona [His sister], Laurene is descended from Joe Namath and we’re descended from John Muir.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We wanted to live in a neighbourhood where kids could walk to see friends.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Carr Jones] He was a careful craftsman who was self-taught.  He cared more about being inventive than about making money, and he never got rich.  He never left California.  His ideas came from reading books in the library and Architectural Digest.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It turns out that Americans make washers and dryers all wrong.  The Europeans make them much better – but they take twice as long to do clothes!  It turns out that they wash them with about a quarter as much water and your clothes end up with a lot less detergent on them.  Most important, they don’t trash your clothes.  They use a lot less soap, a lot less water, but they come out much cleaner, much softer, and they last a lot longer.  We spent some time in our family talking a lot about design, but also about the values of our family.  Did we care most about getting our wash done in an hour versus an hour and a half?  Or did we care most about our clothes feeling really soft and lasting longer?  Did we care about using a quarter of the water?  We spent about two weeks talking about this every night at the dinner table.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On getting a Miele washer and dryer] I got more thrill out of them than I have out of any piece of high tech in years.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Burrell [Smith] was so funny and naïve, and then one April day he suddenly snapped.  It was the weirdest, saddest thing.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To Andy Hertzfeld on bailing Burrell Smith out of jail] If something similar happened to me, would you take as good care of me as you do Burrell?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On a late night phone conversation with Jobs [Bill] Clinton asked how he should handle the Lewinsky issue] I don’t know if you did it, but if so, you’ve got to tell the country.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On not going to Lisa’s Harvard graduation in 2000] She didn’t even invite me. <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-16.html">16<a/> </p><p><BR>
