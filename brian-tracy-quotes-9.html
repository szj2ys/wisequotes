Manage by exception.  Only require reporting when there is a deviation from the plan.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>

<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is not failure itself that holds you back; it is the fear of failure that paralyses you.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most people achieved their greatest success one step beyond what looked like their greatest failure.

<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The history of the human race is the history of ordinary people who have overcome their fears and accomplished extraordinary things.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Do the thing you fear, then the death of fear is certain.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Self-esteem and self-love are the opposites of fear; the more you like yourself, the less you fear anything.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Ignorance breeds fear; the more you learn about your subject, the less fear it holds for you.
<BR><a href="brian-tracy-quotes.html">Brian Tracy<a/>

Resolve in advance to persist until you succeed, no matter what the difficulty.
