<BR>
<BR>
Don’t just park money in the bank.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I want to help people to help themselves…
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There’s no point in… just giving them money
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The Overseas Chinese habit is to save a lot and make a lot of friends.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2002] There are abundant business opportunities to bring about the recovery of the local economy.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003] The [Henderson] Group possesses substantial recurrent income.  
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Quality is a cornerstone of the [Henderson] Group underpinning all our activities.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Comprehensive after-sale property management service is as important as building quality.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Property prices depend mainly on the supply and demand of a particular point in time, in much the same way as the price for a commodity is fixed.  
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2007 on Hong Kong’s biggest achievements in the past 10 years.] Hong Kong has remained a strong financial centre.  It has a solid business environment and geographically, it is well located, being next to China.  During this time, there is no city that can match it.  
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007 on what has been one of the biggest achievements for him in the last 10 years.] I worked with many departments in China to organise a  ‘One million farmer’ programme.  The scheme trained them to learn professional skills.    
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his expectations for Henderson Group in 2007 for the next 10 years.] The Group has three areas.  The first is Henderson Land the listed company.  Now it has a total developable land bank of 75 million square feet of gross floor area in China.  I hope that in the next two or three months that figure can rise to 150 million square feet.  That would be a remarkable feet.  So, Henderson is one hope.  The second is Hong Kong and China Gas, which I also have high hopes for.  In the mainland we already have had many projects in 12 cities there.  No, actually I mean, we have projects in 55 cities in 12 provinces.  Probably about 60 in total that we are working on.  So that is the second area.  The third area or hope is Shau Kee Finance.  It’s assets have already doubled from $50 billion and I hope they can double again to $200 billion.  
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On what he hopes for personally in 2007.] Personally, I just hope that my family keeps getting bigger and bigger.  That would make me very happy.      
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The Chinese who left the mother country had to struggle, and that became a culture of its own, passed on… through each generation.  Because we have no social security, the overseas Chinese habit is not to spend a lot and to make a lot of friends.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2012] We are in turbulent times.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On where investors will make money in 2012] Paper money will suffer.  I’d be in mortar, not paper (money).  We are in a time when paper investments are riskier than in the past.  There is also a great amount of sovereign risk.  
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Gold is a kind of mortar and offers a form of capital preservation.  We’re still bullish about gold.

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2012] The U.S. is talking about keeping interest rates near zero.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On investing in real estate in 2012] Yields will rise with prices, and this will generate steady income.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On what monetary policy tightening in 2011 means in 2012 for China.  The authorities will be] In a position to be more accommodating.  There are some lights at the end of the tunnel.  If political leaders in Europe can put things in order, things will be better.  These days, much relies on politics.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Use money to make money.  Save your ‘first bucket of gold.’ or small fortune – but then use it for investments.  Don’t just park money in the bank.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Find a job that you will be happy with and work hard at.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t marry too early in life. It’s better to work hard when young and establish a career first.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Giving away money to the right cause, with a leveraged effect and your own involvement in how it is spent, will ‘give you peace of mind.’
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
For those already successful, money can become a controlling factor in life and make you a slave to it.  One way to avoid that – Philanthropy.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On philanthropy – Eg by helping one million farmers find jobs he helped three million people when you consider the average number in their family.] Try to maximize the number of people that can benefit from an individual contribution.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On training one million children of farmers to work in the city, where they will earn higher wages and therefore be able to support their families back on the farm.] I want to help people to help themselves, which is much more valuable for both sides than just making a donation.  By training the child of a farmer you compound the value of that dollar spent on training since that child will now help their parents.  This is the multiplier effect.  There’s no point in just feeding them or just giving them money.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1994] In the old days, Hong Kong was undeveloped, coming from a low base.  Now it is on a high base, making it difficult to earn high multiples.  We will certainly diversify out of Hong Kong and out of property.  [On being asked where?] I don’t know.  I haven’t found it yet.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes, your friend can influence you more than your mother.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1996] Hong Kong still offers the best value.  
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1996] For now, if the Hong Kong environment doesn’t change, then in the long term, investing in Hong Kong is best.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2000] Hi-tech is best managed by younger people.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010 on questions on whether new unit sales at record prices were genuine at 39 Conduit Road.] A false transaction using my own people to buy the flat?  I’ll make a bet with you.  For every HK$10,000 you put down, I’ll wager HK$1 million.  
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010 on sales of 39 Conduit Road] If they really don’t want to buy the flats, I’ll take their deposits.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t be so nervous.  It’s not a big deal.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I already told you that it is 100% outside buyers.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Why do you ask so much?
