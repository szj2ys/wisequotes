[On building another new casino] I always think no-one’s going to show up.  That’s probably why I over-designed the place.

You are brought to a table to do a job.

Everything in China is bigger and faster than every place in the world and it puts a tremendous pressure on the government to balance all of this.

<BR>
[In March 2012] Everything in China is bigger and faster than every place in the world…

<BR>
<BR>
[On problems in China] I have enough trouble picking the carpet in my hallway here…

Hypocrisy is part of politics everywhere.

[On his part of helping to change Las Vegas] Vegas wasn’t really the place where you really got lit up on vacation.  And I thought boy, why not bring the ideas and the feelings and the dynamics of other places to bear? 
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>

[On coming up with the vision for the Mirage Casino] One night I was watching Johnny Carson, and Neil Simon was on and I think Doc Simon was plugging ‘California Suite’ or something like that.  Johnny says to Doc Simon  ‘Well, how to you do it?  How do you make the comedy?  And Neil Simon says… ‘Well Johnny, I look for conflict.  That’s where the humor comes from.’  And the next day I just bought the property from [Howard] Hughes and I went out to the Sands Hotel, and parked my little Mercedes.  And I got out of the car, and sat on the front hood of the car, cause they let me park by the curb.   And I was looking at the land I had bought, and I said ‘Conflict’.  I was thinking of Neil Simon, and then an idea came into my mind, an image of Josh Logan the director, doing ‘South Pacific’ and I heard Juanita Hall’s voice, singing ‘Bally Hine’… And I said to myself, ‘Suppose that, what you see with your eyes, is not what your brain tells you should be there?’  Where in the harsh southern of outer desert, suppose you saw Polynesia, South Pacific, wouldn’t that make people say ‘Could the inside of this place be as cool as the outside and that would provoke them to go in.  And that’s how the volcano and the Mirage notion came.  I remember, looking back on it that first I had an idea of conflict to provoke people and to engage their curiosity, and ever since then, every time that I been faced with one of these projects, I say to myself quietly, before anything else, first let’s try and get our arms around an idea, and then we’ll get the stuff.

[On opening one of his new casinos] This is my favorite time.  When we start designing this place, like all these hotels it was four or five years ago.  Some of the decisions were made a long time ago and you forget and then when all the scaffolding comes down, and the bandages come off, and it’s cleaned up… The kids are in here having practice, like now and the place is alive, it’s almost as if you see it for the first time, even if you designed it yourself with your friends.

[On Encore] The casino is all surrounded by glass…

<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
I always thought that when a developer talks about his own hotel, you have to sort of discount anything that they say…
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On positive speak of his new Encore Casino before his official opening] The truth will prevail, regardless of what Steve Wynn or anyone else has to say about it.
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On building bigger and better casinos each time, learning more from each casino he builds] Each one of these places exists because of the things we learnt before.

[On the importance of nightclubs in casinos in December 2008] The young people of today want to be part of the show, they don’t want to watch it.
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the ongoing evolution of casino design] We’ve changed, we’ve learned.  We’re students of this, we’ve never been a master of it.  
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On there being 108,000 job applications for 5,400 jobs in 2008 at his new Encore Casino opening] It was tougher to get a job here than to get into Harvard.

[On not subscribing to the idea of job layoffs in 2008] I never want my employees to be frightened.  If they’re happy and safe they’ll take care of the guests.
