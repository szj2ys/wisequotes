Skepticism and pessimism aren’t synonymous. Skepticism calls for pessimism when optimism is excessive. But it also calls for optimism when pessimism is excessive.

<BR><B>Louis Glickman</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I had been trading since my fourteenth year. I had made my first thousand dollars when I was a kid of fifteen, and my first ten thousand before I was twenty-one. I had made and lost a ten thousand dollar stake more than once. In New York I had made thousands and lost them. I got up to fifty thousand dollars and two days later that went. I had no other business and knew no other game. After several years I was back where I began. No – worse, for I had acquired habits and a style of living that required money; though that part didn’t bother me as much as being wrong so consistently.
<BR><a href="jesse-livermore-quotes.html">Jesse Livermore<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I could improve your ultimate financial welfare by giving you a ticket with only twenty slots in it so that you had twenty punches – representing all the investments that you get to make in a lifetime. And once you’d punched through the card, you couldn’t make any more investments at all. Under those rules, you’d really think carefully about what you did, and you’d be forced to load up on what you’d really thought about. So you’d do so much better.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We don’t get paid for being busy, we get paid for being right.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t know anyone who [learned to be a great investor] with great rapidity. Warren has gotten to be one hell of a lot better investor over the period I’ve know him, as have I. So the game is to keep learning. You have to like the learning process. I’ve watched Warren for decades. Warren has learned a lot, which has allowed him to [expand his circle of competence so he could invest in something like Petro China]. If you’ve going to be an investor, you’re going to make some investments where you don’t have all the experience you need. But if you keep trying to get a little better over time, you’ll start to make investments that are virtually certain to have a good outcome. The keys are discipline, hard work and practice. It’s like playing golf – you have to work on it. If you don’t keep learning, other people will pass you by.
