<BR>
A higher earnings yield is better than a lower one.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Buying a share of a good business is better than buying a share of a bad business.  
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Businesses that earn a high return on capital are better than businesses that earn a low return on capital.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Buying good businesses at bargain prices is the secret to making lots of money.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies that achieve a high return on capital are likely to have a special advantage of some kind.  That special advantage keeps competitors from destroying the ability to earn above-average profits.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Limit your stock investments to a small number of ‘good’ companies that are available at bargain levels.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The more confidence I have in each one of my stock picks, the fewer companies I need to own in my portfolio to feel comfortable.

Many studies over the years have confirmed that value-oriented strategies beat the market over longer time horizons. Several different measures of value have been shown to work.  These strategies include, but are not limited to, selecting stocks based upon low ratios of price to book value, price to earnings, price to cashflow, price to dividends… these simple value strategies do not always work.  However, measured over longer periods, they do.  Though these strategies have been well documented over many years, most individual and professional investors do not have the patience to use them.  Apparently the periods of underperformance makes them difficult – and, for some professionals, impractical to implement.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Another problem with these simple methods, is that, though they work well, they work far better with smaller and medium capitalisation stocks than with larger stocks.  Companies that are too small for professionals to buy and that are not large enough to generate sufficient commission revenue to justify analyst coverage are more likely to be ignored or misunderstood.  As a result, they are more likely to present opportunities to find bargain-priced stocks.

If your goal is to beat the market, an MBA or a Ph.D. from a top business school will be of virtually not help.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most of Wall Street must also ignore the academics because the whole concept of getting paid for your investment advice, whether through commissions or investment advisory fees, doesn’t square too well with the idea that the advice really isn’t worth anything.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Better not to buy a bad company in the first place – But] By not placing all your eggs in a buggy-whip, breast-implant, pet-rock, or huckapoo-sweater company, you can diversify that portion of your risk that comes from the misfortunes of any individual company.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Few people can combine the ability, knowledge, and timing to foresee and profit consistently from future events.  Whether the in-laws can or cannot predict the future is beside the point; they don’t have to – they already know how to profit from studying the present.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you spend your energies looking for and analysing situations not closely followed by other informed investors, your chance of finding bargains greatly increases.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Do your own work.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t trust anyone over thirty.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t trust anyone thirty or under.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One perennial problem is the overwhelming incentive for analysts to issue ‘Buy’ recommendations…it’s much easier to generate commissions from new ‘Buy’ recommendations than from recommendations to ‘Sell’.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
‘Hold’ and ‘untimely’ are used instead of the more direct ‘Sell’ recommendation.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>

<BR>
Your broker, trustworthy or not, has no idea how to invest your money.

The most successful horse players (I guess they lose the least) are the ones who don’t bet on every race but wager on only those occasions when they have a clear conviction.  
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It makes sense that if you limit your investments to those situations were you are knowledgeable and confident, and only those situations, your success rate will be very high.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is no sense diluting your best ideas or favorite situations by continuing to work your way down a list of attractive opportunities.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t screw up a perfectly good stock-market strategy by diversifying your way into mediocre returns.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Decisions to buy and sell stocks should be based solely on the investment merits.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Using past price movements as the basis for determining the riskiness of a particular stock can often lead to faulty conclusions.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One way to create an attractive risk/reward situation is to limit downside risk severely by investing in situations that have a large margin of safety.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Once you’ve gone to the trouble of finding an interesting investment in a remote corner of the market, hopefully your analysis won’t have to be any more subtle than figuring out whether an anvil fell on your head.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Prices fluctuate more than values—so therein lies opportunity.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>

People invest with their emotions.   They process information differently.

You don’t have to be the best in the world at figuring stuff out.

<BR>
For a guy starting out there is always an opportunity to do original work.
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>

Each mistake leads to better insights and subtleties.

You do have to do your homework.

You want to work under somebody you respect.  If you can I would look at it as a learning experience.  
<BR><a href="joel-greenblatt-quotes.html">Joel Greenblatt<a/>

You have to screw up a bunch and learn from it.
