<BR>
It’s a waste of energy to be angry with a man who behaves badly, just as it is to be angry with a car that won’t go.
<BR><B>Bertrand Russell</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t care how intelligent or attractive someone is, if he zaps your energy, he isn’t for you. True chemistry is more than intellectual compatibility. Beyond surfaces, you must be intuitively at ease.
<BR><B>Judith Orloff</B>  
 <BR>
<BR>
Love always brings difficulties, that is true, but the good side of it is that it gives energy.
<BR><B>Vincent Van Gogh</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The energy of the mind is the essence of life. 
<BR><B>Aristotle</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t hold to anger, hurt or pain.  They steal your energy and keep you from love.
<BR><B>Anonymous</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe in energies. Good energy has served me well. Being fair with others, compassionate towards them, remaining humble, and making a difference to someone are just a few of the things that I have seen create good energy. Beautiful things. Human things. I do my best to surround myself with these types of things, to generate an atmosphere thick with such energy. It has kept me safe in many situations. I have taken risks in the past, and managed to avoid harm by the protection of the good energy I have created around me. I believe that ugliness creates more ugliness. And no matter how touched by ugliness you are, you do not have to give in to it and start spreading it beyond yourself. I have seen this sickness and what it does to a person, and those around them.
<BR><B>Ashly Lorenzana</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Goals provide the energy source that powers our lives.  One of the best ways we can get the most from the energy we have is to focus it.  That is what goals can do for us; concentrate our energy.
<BR><B>Denis Waitley</B>
<BR>
<BR>
If people around you aren’t going anywhere, if their dreams are no bigger than hanging out on the corner, or if they’re dragging you down, get rid of them.  Negative people can sap your energy so fast, and they can take your dreams from you, too.
<BR><B>Earvin ‘Magic’ Johnson</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Love is like the sun: has its inner energy source that shines on you.
<BR><B>Helene Lagerberg</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I know it is something of a cliche to say that love makes all things possible, but I believe it does. It is not a magic wand that can be waved over life to make it all sweet and lovely and trouble free, but it can give the energy to fight the odds and win.
<BR><B>Mary Balogh</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It takes a lot more energy to fail than to succeed, since it takes a lot of concentrated energy to hold on to beliefs that don’t work.
<BR><B>Jerry Gillies</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The most essential factor is persistence-the determination never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by the discouragement that must inevitably come.
<BR><B>James Whitcomb Riley</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Genius is that energy which collects, combines, amplifies, and animates.
<BR><B>Samuel Johnson</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Failure is more frequently from want of energy than want of capital.
<BR><B>Daniel Webster</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Real wealth is ideas plus energy.
<BR><B>Richard Buckminster Fuller</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Spiritual energy flows in and produces effects in the phenomenal world.
<BR><B>William James</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Feeling of hatred unto your enemy 
drains your energy as enemy wanted.
<BR><B>Toba Beta</B>
<BR>
<BR>
A strong, successful man is not the victim of his environment.  He creates favourable conditions.  His own inherent force and energy compel things to turn out as he desires.
<BR><B>Orison Swett Marden</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Make it a rule of life never to regret and never to look back.  Regret is an appalling waste of energy.  You can’t build on it, it’s only good for wallowing in.
<BR><B>Katherine Mansfield</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Goals help you channel your energy into action.
<BR><B>Les Brown</B>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
The more willing you are to surrender to the energy within you, the more power can flow through you.
<BR><B>Shakti Gawain</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Happiness gives us the energy which is the basis of health.
<BR><B>Henri-Frederic Amiel</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
It is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil. If they would only expend the same amount of energy loving their fellow men, the devil would die in his own tracks of ennui. 
<BR><B>Helen Keller</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Feeling sorry for yourself, and your present condition, is not only a waste of energy but the worst habit you could possibly have.
<BR><B>Dale Carnegie</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Energy is the essence of life.  Every day you decide how you’re going to use it by knowing what you want and what it takes to reach that goal, and by maintaining focus.
<BR><B>Oprah Winfrey</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Determination, energy, and courage appear spontaneously when we care deeply about something. We take risks that are unimaginable in any other context. 
<BR><B>Margaret J Wheatley</B>
 <BR>
<BR>
All the breaks you need in life wait within your imagination, Imagination is the workshop of your mind, capable of turning mind energy into accomplishment and wealth. 
<BR><a href="napoleon-hill-quotes.html">Napoleon Hill<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most people spend more time and energy going around problems than in trying to solve them.
<BR><B>Henry Ford</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
With four people you can create one very strong kind of energy, but if you can get 65 people working together, and swinging together, that's a whole other kind of energy. 
<BR><B>Chuck Mangione</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Energy may be likened to the bending of a cross bow; decision, to the releasing of the trigger.
<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t be afraid to fail.  Don’t waste energy trying to cover up failure.  Learn from your failures and go on to the next challenge.  It’s OK to fail.  If you’re not failing, you’re not growing.
<BR><B>Anonymous</B>
<BR>
<BR>
What most persons consider as virtue, after the age of 40 is simply a loss of energy. 
<BR><B>Voltaire</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
The energy born of love is creative – it makes everything it touches new. To see how passionate you are, look around at what you have created.
<BR><a href="deepak-chopra-quotes.html">Deepak Chopra<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When you are in the valley, keep your goal firmly in view and you will get the renewed energy to continue the climb.
<BR><B>Denis Waitley</B>

I must choose between despair and Energy - I choose the latter.
<BR><B>John Keats</B>

<BR><B>Oprah Winfrey</B>

I know that what you call 'God' really exists, but not in the form you think; God is primal cosmic energy, the love in your body, your integrity, and your perception of the nature in you and outside of you. 
<BR><B>Wilhelm Reich</B>
<BR>
<BR>
A complainer is like a Death Eater because there's a suction of negative energy. You can catch a great attitude from great people.
