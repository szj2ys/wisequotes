At our beauty shows we do not like a beauty consultant to think, ‘How much can I sell these women?’  Instead we stress, ‘What can I do to make these women leave here today feeling better about themselves?  How can I help them have a better self-image?’
<BR><a href="mary-kay-ash-quotes.html">Mary Kay Ash<a/>

When we began our adoptee program, it was generally felt that it wouldn’t work.  But I knew that it would.  I knew it would work because it was based on the Golden Rule.  At Mary Kay Cosmetics we sometimes call it the ‘go-give’ principle.  It’s a philosophy based on giving, and it is applied in every aspect of our business.  At our beauty shows we do not like a beauty consultant to think, ‘How much can I sell these women?’  Instead we stress, ‘What can I do to make these women leave here today feeling better about themselves?  How can I help them have a better self-image?’
<BR><a href="mary-kay-ash-quotes.html">Mary Kay Ash<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The Golden Rule teaches us to ‘Do unto others as we would have others do unto us.’… Of course, it was meant for everyone, but what a perfect rule of conduct for people managers!  Unfortunately many people today consider the Golden Rule a tiresome cliché, but it still is the best key to people management.  At Mary Kay Cosmetics we take it very seriously.  Every people-management decision made is based on the Golden Rule.  I truly believe that the Golden Rule was intended to be used seven days a week – not just on Sunday.  And that is should be employed in every relationship – business or personal.  When you use this rule – every decision becomes a right decision.
<BR><a href="mary-kay-ash-quotes.html">Mary Kay Ash<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Help other people get what they want – and you’ll get what you want.
<BR><a href="mary-kay-ash-quotes.html">Mary Kay Ash<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Every person is special!  I sincerely believe this.  Each of us wants to feel good about himself or herself, but to me it is just as important to make others feel the same way.  Whenever I meet someone, I try to imagine him wearing an invisible sign that says: Make Me Feel Important!  I respond to this sing immediately, and it works wonders.
<BR><a href="mary-kay-ash-quotes.html">Mary Kay Ash<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The most important justification for being in business is service to others.  Every new business must be built upon the premise, since wanting to make money or desiring to ‘dabble’ in a favorite pastime are not enough to sustain such a venture.  The business must fulfill a need.
<BR><a href="mary-kay-ash-quotes.html">Mary Kay Ash<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe that you should praise people whenever you can; it causes them to respond as a thirsty plant responds to water.
<BR><a href="mary-kay-ash-quotes.html">Mary Kay Ash<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In business everything is subject to change – people, products, buildings, machinery, everything – except principles.  To paraphrase Thomas Jefferson, in matters of principle, stand like a rock; in other matters, swim with the current.  So, while I strongly advocate flexibility, when it comes to principles we must stand firm.
<BR><a href="mary-kay-ash-quotes.html">Mary Kay Ash<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I always look each person squarely in the eyes and whenever possible, try to say something personal.  It might be only a comment such as ‘I love your hair’, or ‘What a beautiful dress you’re wearing,’ but I give each person my undivided attention, and I don’t allow anything to distract me.  Each person whose hand I shake is the most important person in the world at that moment.
<BR><a href="mary-kay-ash-quotes.html">Mary Kay Ash<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Every failure, obstacle or hardship is an opportunity in disguise.  Success in many cases is failure turned inside out.  The greatest pollution problem we face today is negativity.  Eliminate the negative attitude and believe you can do anything.  Replace if I can, I hope, and maybe with can, I will, and I must.
