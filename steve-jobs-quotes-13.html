I can see why John [Lennon] fell in love with her.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>If we use my voice, when people find out they will say it’s about me.  It’s not.  It’s about Apple.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’ve been back about ten weeks, working really hard.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>What we’re trying to do is not highfalutin.  We’re trying to get back to the basics of great products, great marketing, and great distribution.  Apple has drifted away from doing the basics really well.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I went back to Apple and tried to hire a CEO, with the help of a recruiting agency, for almost four months.  But they didn’t produce the right people.  That’s why I finally stayed.  Apple was in no shape to attract anybody good.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It was rough, really rough, the worst time in my life.  I had a young family.  I had Pixar.  I would go to work at 7 a.m. and I’d get back at 9 at night, and the kids would be in bed.  And I couldn’t speak, I literally couldn’t.  I was so exhausted.  I couldn’t speak to Laurene.  All I could do was watch a half hour of TV and vegetate.  It got close to killing me.  I was driving up to Pixar and down to Apple in a black Porsche convertible, and I started to get kidney stones.  I would rush to the hospital and the hospital would give me a shot of Demerol in the butt and eventually I would pass it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To Michael Dell in response to a negative comment] CEOs are supposed to have class.  I can see that isn’t an opinion you hold.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Michael Dell] We’re coming after you buddy.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I discovered that the best innovation is sometimes the company, the way you organize a company.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>The whole notion of how you build a company is fascinating.  When I got the chance to come back to Apple, I realized that I would be useless without the company, and that’s why I decided to stay and rebuild it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It was the dumbest thing in the world to let companies making crappier hardware use our operating system and cut into our sales.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do.  That’s true for companies, and it’s true for products.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Well good, because I need someone to do grunt work.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I hate the way people use slide presentations instead of thinking.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>People would confront a problem by creating a presentation.  I wanted them to engage, to hash things out at the table, rather than show a bunch of slides.  People who know what they’re talking about don’t need Powerpoint.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On not being focused] I had people explaining this to me for three weeks.  I couldn’t figure it out.  Which ones do I tell my friends to buy?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>You are bright people.  You shouldn’t be wasting your time on such crappy products.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I came out of the meeting with people who had just gotten their products cancelled and they were three feet off the ground with excitement because they finally understood where in the heck we were going.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Stop!  This is crazy.  Here’s what we need.  Consumer + Pro.  Desktop + Portable.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>I can make it work.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I don’t understand.  You’re going to ship a million and not make money on these?  This is nuts.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On the Newton] If Apple had been in a less precarious situation, I would have drilled down myself to figure out how to make it work.  I didn’t trust the people running it.  My gut was there was some really good technology, but it was f*cked up by mismanagement.  By shutting it down, I freed up some good engineers who could work on new mobile devices.  And eventually we got it right when we moved on to iPhones and the iPad.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Apple] We were less than ninety days from being insolvent.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Oh, and one more thing … Think Profit.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The difference that Jony has made, not only at Apple but in the world, is huge.  He is a wickedly intelligent person in all ways.  He understands business concepts, marketing concepts.  He picks up just like that, click.  He understands what we do at our core better than anyone.  If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it’s Jony.  Jony and I think up most of the products together and then pull others in and say, ‘Hey, what do you think about this?’  He gets the big picture as well as the most infinitesimal details about each product.  And he understands that Apple is a product company.  He’s not just a designer.  That’s why he works directly for me.  There’s no one who can tell him what to do, or to butt out.  That’s the way I set it up.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It takes a toll of hard work., to make something simple, to truly understand the underlying challenges and come up with elegant solutions.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>In most people’s vocabularies, design means veneer.  But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.  Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We wanted to get rid of anything other than what was absolutely essential.  To do so required total collaboration between the designers, the product developers, the engineers, and the manufacturing team.  We kept going back to the beginning, again and again.  Do we need that part?  Can we get it to perform the function of the other four parts?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Does doing this make sense, because over here is where we are growing a lot?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>That’s no good.  That’s not very good.  I like that one.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>[Like Wayne Gretzky] Skate to where the puck’s going, not where it’s been.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>That’s cool!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>When we took it to the engineers, they cam up with thirty-eight reasons why they couldn’t do it.  And I said, ‘No, no, we’re doing this.’  And they said, ‘Well, why?’  And I said, ‘Because I’m the CEO, and I think it can be done.  And so they kind of grudgingly did it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On the iMac name] I don’t hate it this week, but I still don’t like it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>You know we’re trying to save the company here, and you guys are screwing it up!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On a CD tray opening out] What the f*ck is this?  No, there was never a tray, just a slot. <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I almost started crying, because it was too late to do anything about it.  I’m only going to go ahead with the launch if you promise we’re going to go to slot mode as soon as possible.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Keep it in.  I don’t care.  We’re using it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>You guys don’t know what you’re doing!  I’m going to get someone else to do the ads, because this is f*cked up.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Not.  F*cking. Blue.
