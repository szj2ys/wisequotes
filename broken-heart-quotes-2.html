Falls cold and ceaseless, wore my heart away!

Bad as I like ye, it's worse without ye.  
<BR><B>Irish Proverb</B>

Love never dies a natural death.  It dies because we don’t know how to replenish it’s source.  It does of blindness and errors and betrayals.  It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of withering, of tarnishing.
