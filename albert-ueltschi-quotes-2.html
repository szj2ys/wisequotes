<BR>
It doesn’t make sense to train in aircraft when you can train under controlled conditions in a simulator.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Before we became part of Berkshire, when we were on the New York Stock Exchange, I was constantly questioned about how much money we were going to make the next quarter and why we didn’t make more the last quarter.  Now we run the company for the long term without worrying about the next quarter.  That’s one of the best things about working with Warren [Buffett].
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Leadership is really what being a good manager is all about.  And the letters of the word represent the qualities that a good manager should have.  L is for loyalty and E is for enthusiasm.  A stands for attitude, and D is for discipline.  E stands for example – you have to set a good example – and R is for respect.  S represents scholarliness, and H is for honesty.  And I and P stand for integrity and pride.  The thing I like the best about Warren Buffett is that he possesses all these qualities.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I try to make him [Warren Buffett] proud and I try to make every shareholder proud.  I feel very obligated to try to do that.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t want to run a company that you read bad things about in the newspaper.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My mother and father were my biggest influences.  They probably did more for me than anybody.  We didn’t have much money on that farm down in Kentucky, but we were rich in a lot of other ways.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being asked if his parents would be proud of his success.] I don’t really consider my success.  I never think of that.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On describing himself.] Just a lucky person, born at the right place and the right time.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You have to figure out how you’re going to make more in revenues than expenses.  That’s the biggest thing to do.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the future of aviation training and FlightSafety’s position.] People are traveling more, and they’re going to continue to travel more.  The industry has unlimited opportunity, and not only in America.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being asked whether there will ever be another Warren Buffett?] No, but there will never be another George Washington or Abraham Lincoln, either.  There are other people around who are smart.  Everyone is replaceable somewhere along the line.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Warren Buffett has] A pretty good master plan.  He’s smart – he’s got ideas of who’s going to do what.  He wants to know who is going to take my place if I should get hit by a streetcar, so I’m sure he has a plan for who will replace him if he should not be around.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Berkshire Hathaway if Warren Buffett dies.] I don’t see what the big concern is.  If he dies, what the heck’s going to happen?  Do they think everyone else is going to die too?  Warren doesn’t tell me how to run FlightSafety, and he doesn’t tell any of the other operating managers how to run their companies either.  Once Warren’s gone, sooner or later, you’ll have to have someone in there, but in the meantime these companies all know how to operate.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2002] I’m doing what I like to do.  This isn’t work for me – it’s play.  Warren [Buffett] and I have a deal.  He said he’ll ever split the Berkshire stock.  The only thing he’ll do is, when I’m 100, he’ll split my age and I’ll be 50.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I can tell you, honest to God, that money has never been that important to me.  It really hasn’t.  I never did this to get rich.  
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Money is the reward you get that can be measured.  But there are bigger things than that.  You have to have a good feeling that you are doing something that is really contributing, not only to your bank account but to something else as well.  I really feel that our business is making a contribution to flight safety.  It’s really great to do something that’s making a contribution and also to be rewarded for it.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Orbis International which he was greatly involved with and helped found in 1977.] Orbis, is a Greek word, a word with two meanings.  One meaning is ‘eyes,’ and the other is ‘around the world.’ 
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Forty five million people are blind today, and this figure will double in the next 20 years if we don’t take action now.  Nine out of 10 of the world’s blind live in developing countries.  According to the World Health Organization and ophthalmologists, 80 percent of this blindness could be prevented or cured because the treatments available for the prevention and cure of blindness are among the most low-cost and effective of all health-care work.  It’s a shame, because if you had a child that was blind and you could do something about it and didn’t, you’d be sick.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We’re all just human beings and we all do the best we can.  We can make a difference by helping people.  We have the greatest opportunities in the world.  Sure, you want to win.  We all want to win.  We play hard to win.  So what if you don’t?  It’s like playing golf.  Tiger Woods doesn’t always win.  But that’s what life is all about – it’s a game.  What are you going to do?  I don’t say, ‘When I die,’ I say, ‘if I die.’
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his grandparents immigrating from Switzerland to America] If my grandparents had stayed in Switzerland, imagine what would have happened then.  I wouldn’t be doing what I’m now.  I’d have been a watchmaker or something.

<BR>
I loved airplanes from the very beginning.  From when I was 5 years old, on the farm, I used to tell my dad I liked airplanes and that I wanted to fly.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At age 95 on whether he had accomplished all he wanted to do in life.] No.  You never know what’s next to do.  That’s the way life is.  If you knew exactly what you were going to do and did it then what else would you do.    
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t think that you should say ‘this is all I’m going to do to live to be 100 years old’ – Don’t do that – go to 200 years.  
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At age 95] I do fly.  But when I fly though I have a pilot and whitestay with me…
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On older flyers like Arnold Palmer.] If you have enough money to buy an airplane and don’t have enough sense to have a pilot go with you – especially on a jet –  then you shouldn’t have an airplane.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On how the aviation industry has evolved during this time.] I never had any idea where it was going to evolve.  I just knew aeroplanes…
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I just liked aeroplanes…
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I didn’t have a masterplan.  
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At age 95] I’ve been a pilot all my life.  Oh well – seventy something years, seventy four years.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A lot of people have died in aeroplanes because they made mistakes.  
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No-one should get killed on an aeroplane.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On flying modern aeroplanes.] People become complacent…. And when you become complacent… They have to train more today than they ever did.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
About 75,000 pilots every year we train.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You gotta take in more than you spend.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I met Warren [Buffett] I could tell that I liked him.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When you have shareholders, you’ve gotta do what’s best for them.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On some company buyers breaking it up and selling off the pieces.] I know Warren Buffett, he’s not someone who would try to break something up.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s good to be doing something [useful] and to make some money out of it too.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At age 95 on questions on whether he will retire?] When I’m not producing anymore, I should step aside.
<BR><a href="albert-ueltschi-quotes.html">Albert Ueltschi<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the importance of Orbis in helping people see.] If they can’t read, they can’t learn and they can’t do anything – and that’s a big problem.
