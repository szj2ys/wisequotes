An alligator rested on the riverbank, unmoving and invisible, watching small fish swim by.  The alligator was hungry, but it didn’t go after the small fry.  The creature waited so calmly that the river’s inhabitants became busy with their own interests and stopped noticing the alligator.  After a long while, a particularly big, succulent-looking fish swam by.  That’s when the beast opened its maw.  The alligator gulped the big fish whole.  I’d like to think, that we can be like the hungry alligator.
