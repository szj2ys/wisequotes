<BR>
I’m lucky I had signposts in my life.  
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
At important times I got pointed in the right direction by particular circumstances.  You can choose a direction that will take you into something that isn’t going to take you where you want to go or you can choose another direction which is down the right pathway.  
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Whether we have enough, only Mr Mansell knows at this stage.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Western Australia’s my home, I love Western Australia.  I love everything about it.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My job has always been putting together the right teams of people to run it without me.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I need any government support but they’re allowed to express their opinion like everybody else.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On celebrating channel seven’s fifty year anniversary] I wasn’t involved in channel seven at the time in 1959, I was still working for the first discounter in Western Australia a company called Ron Shaws…   
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009 on channel seven] People at seven today are every bit as good as who they have taken the baton from.  
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] We believe that free to air television has a very exciting future.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[With a smile] You should be nervous.  You’re being evaluated.  
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On how he got started.]  Well first of all I was born.  Then I was young.  Then I got involved in business and that’s where I am now.  I was at the first telethon 44 years ago…
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the telethon] Every year it’s what we do different and make it different that’s important.  I love the history of telethon.  But right now I thinking about how we’re going to make it better next year.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On how to be successful in business] Work hard… I can’t overemphasise it.  Work hard if you want to be successful work hard.  If you want to be successful get up early work longer, work harder.  Work for me.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I love cars.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the first car I ever owned] It was a 1928 Rugby utility with a gravity feed petrol tank.  
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his opinion of the worst car that’s ever been made] Probably the valiant, the second series after the S…  Yes it was a horrible car.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the best car on the road] I’d love to own a Ferrari.    I love Ferrari’s.  If I drove one you know someone’s going to scratch it.  Imagine having to drive round a scratched Ferrari.  So no I don’t have one.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I drive now a Mercedes…  It’s old and it’s safe and it suits an old fella.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his biggest fear] My biggest fear is failing.  Telethon failing that would be my biggest fear.  Wake up next year and no-one giving any money.  
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his favourite TV show]  Zoom of course.

<BR>
[On the seven west merger] This combined company will have the scale to things in Australia that we weren’t able to do before.  
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the seven west merger] That gives us the opportunities to take advantage of the changes in the technology both here and overseas.  
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In April 2012] I hate the word boom, because there’s always going to be a failure after a thing called a boom.  
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2012] We’ve been an exporter of raw materials both coal and iron ore for the last 50 years.  There have been times when we’ve had higher prices.  There’ve been times when we’ve had lower prices.  What doesn’t change is, we continue to ship the resource.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What’s important to Australia and our future is that we continue to ship the resource and that we’re a good supplier for customers that want our goods.  We’ll continue to do that.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There will be times where we’ll have ups and downs… but Australia’s future is sound.  Our mining industry is sound.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We may have to take the tops and bottoms off but at the end of the day we have a very sound opportunity to build long-term futures as a supplier to our eastern neighbours including China, and Japan and India.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2001] I was shocked and horrified, as I watched live pictures of people jumping to their deaths.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2001] We're now forced to question everything. The way we live our lives, the way we conduct business the way we, as media, fulfil our role.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2001] We must plan for peace.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Aristotle said: "It is more difficult to organise peace, than to win a war, but the fruits of victory will be lost, if the peace is not well organised."
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It's like the waves that follow the tidal wave.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On September 11 in 2001] It's therefore up to us collectively, to be, not mere observers in this issue; but active participants in the solution.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2001] In the world of globalisation and infinite choices, there was, in reality, only one: CNN.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
They may be fanatics, but they weren't stupid.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
They may be fanatics, but they did have the cunning and intellectual-prowess to plan and execute this operation.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On September 11] It's chilling to realise that these people actually used everything in our free and democratic society against us.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
They turned our domestic airlines into bombs. They used our banking systems to fund it. They used our education and training systems to carry it out. They even used our postal service, and for a 50 cent stamp, they brought the frontline, to each and every one of us.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
This can only be addressed at a grass roots level.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Should we be angry? Yes. Should we be involved? Yes. Should we seek questions and answers? Definitely.
<BR><a href="kerry-stokes-quotes.html">Kerry Stokes<a/>
