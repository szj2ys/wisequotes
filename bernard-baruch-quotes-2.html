<BR>
I distrust supposedly versatile people for I have learned that few men can do more than one thing well.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Bears can make money only if the bulls push up stocks to where they are overpriced and unsound.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When misfortune overtakes us, all of us are prone to blame someone else if we can, and usually we think we can.  This instinct for the preservation of self esteem is one of the more deep-seated traits of human nature.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Repeatedly in my market operations I have sold a stock while it still was rising – and that has been one reason why I have held onto my fortune.  Many a time I might have made a good deal more by holding a stock, but then I would also have been caught in the fall when the price of the stock collapsed.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Some people boast of selling at the top of the market and buying at the bottom – I don’t believe this can be done.  I have bought when things seemed low enough and sold when they seemed high enough.  In that way I have managed to avoid being swept along to those wild extremes of market fluctuations which prove so disastrous. 
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Always in the past, no matter how black the outlook, things got better.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What drives the prices of stocks up or down is not impersonal economic forces or changing events but the human reactions to these happenings.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Many a novice will sell something he has a profit in to protect something in which he has a loss.  Since the good stock usually has gone down least, or may even show a profit, it is psychologically easy to let go.  With a bad stock the loss is likely to be heavy and the impulse is to hold onto it in order to recover what has been lost.  Actually, the procedure one should follow is to sell the bad stock and keep the good stock.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The main reason why money is lost in stock speculations is not because Wall Street is dishonest, but because so many people persist in thinking that you can make money without working for it and that the stock exchange is the place where this miracle can be performed.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have no fear of the future.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The next [step] was to build more warehouses and grain elevators so that producers could withhold crops in bad markets and thus bargain on a more even footing with consumers.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Ever since the inflation scare of the 1890’s it had been common practice for creditors to stipulate payment in dollars of the same gold weight as they had lent.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Age is only a number, a cipher for the records.  A man can’t retire his experience.  He must use it.  Experience achieves more with less energy and time.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Vote for the man who promises least; he’ll be the least disappointing.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To me, old age is always fifteen years older than I am.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A political leader must keep looking over his shoulder all the time to see if the boys are still there.  If they aren’t still there, he’s no longer a political leader.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the secrets of a long and fruitful life is to forgive everybody everything every night before you go to bed.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
During my eighty-seven years I have witnessed a whole succession of technological revolutions.  But none of them has done away with the need for character in the individual or the ability to think.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Every man has a right to his opinion, but no man has a right to be wrong in his facts.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The greatest blessing of our democracy is freedom.  But in the last analysis, our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves.

<BR>
Two things are bad for the heart – running up stairs and running down people.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
None of us can be free of conflict and woe.  Even the greatest men have to accept disappointments as their daily bread… The art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than in growing with them.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Do not look for approval except for the consciousness of doing your best.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Always do one thing less than you think you can do.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I have known men who could see through the motivations of others with the skill of a clairvoyant; only to prove blind to their own mistakes.  I have been one of those men.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can overcome anything if you don’t have a bellyache.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A speculator is one who thinks and plans for a future event – and acts before it occurs.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The essence of any plan for financing old age is saving – to put aside some part of today’s earnings for the future.  Anything that saps the value of savings – and inflation is the worst single threat – is the enemy of the aged and of those who expect to grow old.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Our problem in money-making or government affairs is how to remain properly venturesome and experimental without making fools of ourselves.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is too much emphasis on the alleged need for more purchasing power.  What the country needs is stable purchasing power.  Increase wages, higher pensions, more unemployment insurance, all are of no avail if the purchasing power of money falls faster.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Save for gold, jewels, works of art, perhaps good agricultural land, and a very few other things, there ain’t no such animal as a permanent investment.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Colleges don’t teach economics properly. Unfortunately we learn little from the experience of the past. An economist must know, besides his subject, ethics, logic, philosophy, the humanities and sociology, in fact everything that is part of how we live and react to one another.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We can’t cross a bridge until we come to it; but I always like to lay down a pontoon ahead of time.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I get the facts, I study them patiently, I apply imagination.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Unless each man produces more than he receives, increases his output, there will be less for him and all the others.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Try as we may, none of us can be free of conflict and woe. Even the greatest men have had to accept disappointments as their daily bread.... The art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than in growing with them. Man and society must grow together. Each individual’s efforts to discipline himself must be matched by society’s struggle to enforce the rules of law and of justice under the law.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Recipe for success: Be polite, prepare yourself for whatever you are asked to do, keep yourself tidy, be cheerful, don’t be envious, be honest with yourself so you will be honest with others, be helpful, interest yourself in your job, don’t pity yourself, be quick to praise, be loyal to your friends, avoid prejudices, be independent, interest yourself in politics, and read the newspapers.
<BR><a href="bernard-baruch-quotes.html">Bernard Baruch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Whatever task you undertake, do it with all your heart and soul. Always be courteous, never be discouraged. Beware of him who promises something for nothing. Do not blame anybody for your mistakes and failures. Do not look for approval except the consciousness of doing your best.

We didn’t all come over on the same ship, but were all in the same boat.
