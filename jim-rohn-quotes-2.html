He stretched out a piece of string on a table and pulled it a few inches with his finger.  ‘An army is like this piece of string.’ He said.  ‘If you try to push it from behind, it just tangles and doubles back on itself.  Soldiers have to be led from the front, not pushed from behind.’<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you sow, you will reap.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>There is nothing to fear, except fear itself.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>When people asked Socrates, ‘What is wisdom?’ he always gave the same answer: ‘I don’t know’.  In fact, Socrates never claimed to know much of anything except how to ask questions.  And by asking questions, he would prove to other people that they didn’t know what they thought they knew.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>A patient man is always richer than an impatient one, even if the patient man has less money.  Why?  The patient man can always afford to wait.  The patient man is never desperate.  The patient man has time to spare.  While the man in a hurry is always on the verge of bankruptcy as far as time is concerned.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Making the most of your life is unusual.  That’s why you need to develop some unusual habits to earn outstanding rewards.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Each person’s personal philosophy is like the set of a sail.  If you want to trim a better sail, you don’t need a better economy.  You know you can’t change the seasons; you’ve got to take them as they come.  What can you change to make your life work better?  You must start with your philosophy.  Once I got rid of all my old excuses and started examining the real problem – my personal philosophy – my life exploded into change.  My bank account changed immediately.  My income changed immediately.  My whole life instantly took on a new look.  The early results from making these philosophical changes felt so good that I never stopped the process from that day forward.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>There is only one way to make time work for you, not against you: patience.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>In any situation you can think of, impatience is a source of weakness and fear, while patience represents substance and strength.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The nearsighted person sees only the present; the fantasizer sees only an imaginary future and, more likely than not trips over his mistakes trying to get there.  Patience enables you to see the big picture.  It helps you to make the most of today while building a better tomorrow.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Patience and endurance.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>A big part of the lesson was having Mr Shoaff repeat the ideas over and over.  You just can’t hear the fundamentals of life philosophy too often.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you’re full of ideas, pour them out.  As you do, I promise more will be poured in.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you want something badly enough, you have to pay for it.  Why?  Because of the kind of person paying for it will make of you.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>One is a great idea person, the other a great detail person.  They work together, or it wouldn’t work at all.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Too much is too much.  That’s why you need to exercise brevity when it comes to logic and reason.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>He said, Mr Rohn, if you truly wish to be successful, you’ve got to associate with the right people.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Let other people lead small lives.  You are destined for something better.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Everyone has to get good at one of two things: planting in the spring or begging in the fall.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>There’s no failure in pouring your heart and soul and energy into something that doesn’t work.  Rather, failure is not trying at all.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The day that turns your life around.  Disgust; Decision; Desire; Resolve.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Resolve means promising yourself you’ll never give up. <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Promise yourself you’ll read the books until your skills change; you’ll go to seminars until you get a handle on what they’re teaching; you’ll practice until you develop the skills.  Never give up until you’ve gotten what you want.  Don’t miss the chance to grow.  Resolve that you’ll pay the price until you learn, change, grow, and become what you want to be.  You’ll discover some of life’s best treasures when you pay that price.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don’t wish it were easier, wish you were better.  Don’t wish for fewer problems, wish for more skills.  Don’t wish for less challenges, wish for more wisdom.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>There are several studies that show the greatest achievers aren’t those who fail the least.  The greatest achievers are those least frightened of failure.  They’re willing to take on the challenge without the guarantee of success.  They have the desired end in sight, but they’re not sure when it will be or where it will be.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You’ve got to keep trying and trying and trying.  You’ve got to have enough resolve to do it until you succeed.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Fears, even the most basic ones, can totally destroy our ambitions.  Fears can destroy fortunes.  Fear can destroy relationships.  Fear, if left unchecked, can destroy lives.  Fear is one of the many enemies lurking inside of us.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>The enemies inside us: Indifference, Indecision, Doubt, Worry, and Over-caution.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Indecision is the thief of opportunity and enterprise.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Perseverance means you never quit.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The things that are easy to do are also easy not to do.  That’s the difference between success and failure, between daydreams and ambitions.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Dreams are a projection of the kind of life you want to lead.  When you allow your dreams to pull you forward, they unleash a creative force that can overpower everything in your way.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Success is defining a goal and having the resolve to complete it, no matter what.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You see, you can’t change what’s going on around you without first changing what’s going on within you.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You don’t want to waste your time on things that aren’t going to matter.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Formula for failure: errors in judgement repeated every day.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Get in the habit of doing it!  Do all it takes and before you know it, success will be yours for the having.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-16.html">16<a/>  </p><p></p><p><BR>
