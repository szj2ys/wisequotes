<BR>
If you keep throwing punches, you're bound to hit something.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[At the age of 82.] If you haven't got a passion in life you might as well lie down and die. [Still going strongly in 2014 at the age of almost 91.]
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003 at the age of 79.] I've always liked to entertain people.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was just an unknown announcer on a station with a minuscule audience.  So I did what I could to get attention.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003.] I kept throwing punches…
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Even if I knew nothing about them.  I had a go at everything that came along.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’d have a go at anything.  Even things I don’t remember.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010.] If you keep throwing punches you are bound to hit something and you will succeed…  Failure is just a passing fancy.  Because the time comes when it’s your turn.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1967 on foreshadowing that soap operas would be the next big thing in Australian television.] I don't know whether I have the talent or organisation or ability to do these things.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 1977.] Action-adventure and the two-hour telemovies are what people want now.  I don’t think a big budget is necessary to make the [TV] ratings – but I think the public is tougher to please now.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 1984 on developing a modified US Television Game Show based on scrabble.] It’s not pure Scrabble.  The point about TV-game shows is that the people at home have to play along and talk to the set.  Pure scrabble won’t work on television.  Audiences don’t want to see players draw seven letters and then think about the words they will make.  It would be too much like watching the grass grow.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1992.] I work where I sleep, keeping in touch with my world by electronic mail, fax and phone. My work is always with me and that's how I like it.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003 at the age of 79.] I WOULD certainly do it all over again.  
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003.] I enjoyed playing games. The rest followed. I learnt my trade with
game shows and then moved into drama, documentaries, miniseries.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003.] I was always coming up with ideas and putting them to air, often
without the knowledge of management.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003.] I took the Wheel of Fortune radio show idea to Channel 9's CEO, Ken G. Hall, the pioneer of Australian motion pictures.  I explained how I could turn it into a television show. He liked the idea and suddenly I was hosting ‘Wheel’ on television. I had never been in a TV studio before.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003.] I believed that our group's Australian know-how was equal to any in the world.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003.] I kept throwing punches until I finally sold the Australian show Prisoner and in the same year produced an American version of Sale of the Century in the NBC studios in Los Angeles.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On making his home the tax haven of Bermuda in the early 1980’s.] I had to be more centrally placed between the USA and Europe.  We finally chose Bermuda.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2003 on whether he misses TV after having sold his TV empire for $326 million back in 1995.] I am still interested in TV entertainment. RG Capital continues to hold shares in the TV production houses, and I like to see at least one episode of every new game show and drama whenever it is produced.  Having said that, I have also returned to my first love, radio.  RG Capital controls RG Capital Radio which now has a regional network of 38 stations.

<BR>
<BR> 
[In July 2003.] My wife and I travel to many places in the world to allow me to photograph wildlife.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003.] I am having some success expressing motion in still photography, and a good friend of mine who is a prominent Hollywood photographer actually thinks my stuff is good enough to bring out a book next year. We'll see.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003.] The business achievement of which I am most proud is my creation of `parochial internationalism'; an oxymoron, yes, but I saw that to be global, was to be local.  I took our Australian concepts and produced them locally in 18 countries of the world, always using local talent and always having one of my own Australians in charge of production in each country.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003.] I was always interested in the arts.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003.] I was the first Australian ever to call a world title fight. I flew to South Africa in 1952.  Jimmy Carruthers beat Vic Toweel to be the first Australian to win a world title.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003.] I created and hosted a radio show called Wheel of Fortune.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003.] I suppose I was avant-garde.  As we spread around the world, I needed a convenient way of communicating with my producers in different time zones and so I introduced MCI mail to my people.  I was a very early user of computers too, probably circa 1980.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003.] Once I decided to go out into the world, Joy and I made the decision that we would have to leave Australia for me to actually carry out my dream.  I had to be more centrally placed between the USA and Europe.  It was hard for my wife, whose acting career was taking off. We finally chose Bermuda.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003 at the age of 79 on reality shows.] What’s real about having a camera crew recording your every intimate moment?
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003 acknowledging the popularity of the reality tv show ‘Big Brother.’] Big Brother is not to my taste.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> 
[On producing ‘Sale of the Century’ in 1983 for America.] I visited America many times before I got that break.  My philosophy has always been that you must be willing to fail. Just keep throwing punches... you're bound to hit something eventually. Finally (NBC's) Brandon Tartikoff was impressed with my pitch and gave me my chance.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 2003 at the age of 79 about staying active and creative.] I've got a drawer full of drama concepts and formats.  I keep adding to them. Who knows? Maybe one day...  
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2005 on creating shows such as Neighbours, Perfect Match, Prisoner, Wheel of Fortune and Sale of the Century.] I decided to let the shows be the stars.  I know it's a cliché to say, 'Let my work speak for itself. But that's how I feel.    
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2005.] Funnily enough, some have said to me, 'When people hear what you've done, they'll say, wow, we didn't know there was another Reg Grundy.  Because it couldn't possibly be the guy who made all the game shows and serials, would it? So that's why I'm going public. To talk about it.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2005.] It's funny.  Here I am, a man who has made thousands of television programs, yet the first time I showed my photographs to anyone, I had my head down like a little boy.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2005.] I was always drawing as a kid.  I really wanted to be an artist. The one thing I could never imagine being was a businessman, that was an anathema to me.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On going to work at David Jones in women’s fashion sales at the age of 16.] In 1939, Sir Charles Lloyd Jones, the store chairman, called me into his office.  He'd been told I had an interest in art, and said if I were interested, David Jones would pay for my tuition at the Julian Ashton Art School. Once a week, after hours, I found myself standing at an easel with a piece of charcoal, attempting to draw an antique, a head, a nose, an ear. Henry Gibbons [famed head of the school] would ask, 'Do you think the proportions are correct?' Invariably, I would answer, 'I don't suppose so.' He would say, 'Well, let's try again.’  I struggled on, but eventually gave up. My interest in art remained, but my will to conquer drawing had withered and died.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On moving to Bermuda in 1982.] It was purely a business decision.  Twenty years ago, you couldn't run an international business from Australia. Bermuda was between New York and London.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2005.] Australians, by watching my shows, gave me the confidence to go out into the world.
<BR><a href="reg-grundy-quotes.html">Reg Grundy<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2005.] I really believe, in 1952, my life changed.  That was the first time I saw animals in the wild.
