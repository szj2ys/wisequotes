<BR>
Take a man of fair intelligence, give him a fair chance, and he will soon learn to do anything that any other intelligent man is doing.
<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>

My best advice to you is - when you tackle a job stick to it until you have mastered it.
<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can only make money by giving people what they want…
<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If I rest, I’ll rust.
<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My success is the result of not being satisfied with mediocrity, and in making the most of my opportunities.
<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Business is a matter of human service.

<BR>
I’m not going into the chocolate business to add to my wealth.  
<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I started making chocolate I didn’t follow the policies of those already in the business.  If I had, I would never have made a go of it.  Instead, I started out with the determination to make a better nickel chocolate bar than any of my competitors made, and I did so.
<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believed that, if I put a chocolate on the market that was better than any one else was making, or was likely to make, and keep it absolutely uniform in quality, the time would come when the public would appreciate it and buy it.

<BR>
<BR>
We’ll grow!  All we need is time.

<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is remarkable how many viewpoints there are in this world.
<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>

When I left home as a boy to tackle the job of making a living my mother gave me some good advice. She said, 'Milton, you are now going out into the world to make a man of yourself. My best advice to you is - when you tackle a job stick to it until you have mastered it.' I never have forgotten those words and now when I think of the chocolate business and the way it has grown I think it was my mother's advice that spurred me on and helped me to overcome my obstacles.
<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You can only make money by giving people what they want, and by making good use of your opportunities. When I started making chocolate I didn't follow the policies of those already in the business. If I had, I would never have made a go of it. Instead, I started out with the determination to make a better nickel chocolate bar than any of my competitors made, and I did so.
<BR><a href="milton-snavely-hershey-quotes.html">Milton Snavely Hershey<a/>

When I failed in New York City I was able to pay my creditors forty cents on the dollar.  As soon as I got on my feet financially I returned to New York City and paid my creditors the remaining sixty percent of my indebtedness.

Originally I planned to build my factory in Lancaster, but the property owners wanted too much money for their sites, so I looked elsewhere.  I inspected locations in four states, and it was not until then that I was convinced that Derry Township was the most suitable place for me to build the factory.  When my friends learned that I was going to build the factory up here they thought I had gone out of my mind.
