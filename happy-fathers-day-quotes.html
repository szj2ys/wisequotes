Perhaps I was just trying to find a way to teach others what my father had taught me.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
At the beginning of sophomore year (1931) my father told me with regret that he could not contribute even one dollar more to my education. At first this seemed to be a tragedy; but now looking back, it was the best thing that could have happened.
<BR><a href="john-templeton-quotes.html">John Templeton<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
My dear father, whose life was as harsh as your harsh craft, you showed me what patience can accomplish when the task is long. It is to you that I owe my tenacity in carrying out the work that needs to be done from day to day. Not only did you have the qualities of perseverance that make for a useful life, you also had admiration for great men and great things. To aim higher and higher, to learn more and more, to seek constantly to rise, such were the things you taught me.
<BR><a href="louis-pasteur-quotes.html">Louis Pasteur<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The best thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
If my father had not been the kind who encouraged his children to pursue intellectual interests without any thought of profit, our early curiosity about flying would have been nipped too early to bear fruit.
<BR><a href="orville-wright-quotes.html">Orville Wright<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
We never know the love of a parent till we become parents ourselves.
<BR><B>Henry Ward Beecher</B>
<BR>
<BR>
A new father quickly learns that his child invariably comes to the bathroom at precisely the times when he's in there, as if he needed company. The only way for this father to be certain of bathroom privacy is to shave at the gas station.
<BR><B>Bill Cosby</B>
<BR>
<BR>
My father taught me to work; he did not teach me to love it.
<BR><B>Abraham Lincoln</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Nobody ever asks a father how he manages to combine marriage and a career.
<BR><B>Sam Ewing</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I talk and talk and talk, and I haven't taught people in 50 years what my father taught by example in one week.
<BR><B>Mario Cuomo</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Other things may change us, but we start and end with family.
<BR><B>Anthony Brandt</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Dad taught me everything I know. Unfortunately, he didn't teach me everything he knows.
<BR><B>Al Unser</B>
<BR>
<BR>
He didn't tell me how to live; he lived, and let me watch him do it. 
<BR><B>Clarence Budington Kelland</B>
<BR>
<BR>
You don’t choose your family. They are God’s gift to you.
<BR><B>Desmond Tutu</B>
<BR>
<BR>
You don't have to deserve your mother's love. You have to deserve your father's. He's more particular. 
<BR><B>Robert Frost</B>
<BR>
<BR>
My father used to play with my brother and me in the yard.  Mother would come out and say, “You’re tearing up the grass.”  “We’re not raising grass,” Dad would reply.  “We’re raising boys.”  
<BR><B>Harmon Killebrew</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t make a baby if you can’t be a father.
<BR><B>National Urban League slogan</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Fathers, like mothers, are not born. Men grow into fathers - and fathering is a very important stage in their development.
<BR><B>David M Gottesman</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Dad, I may not be the best, but I come to believe that I got it in me to be somebody in this world. And it’s not because I’m so different from you either. It’s because I’m the same. I mean, I can be just as hard-headed, and just as tough. I only hope I can be as good a man as you. 
<BR><B>Jake Gyllenhaal</B>
<BR>
<BR>
A king, realizing his incompetence, can either delegate or abdicate his duties. A father can do neither. If only sons could see the paradox, they would understand the dilemma. 
<BR><B>Marlene Dietrich</B>

<BR>
Henry James once defined life as that predicament which precedes death, and certainly nobody owes you a debt of honor or gratitude for getting him into that predicament.  But a child does owe his father a debt, if Dad, having gotten him into this peck of trouble, takes off his coat and buckles down to the job of showing his son how best to crash through it.  
<BR><B>Clarence Budington Kelland</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes the poorest man leaves his children the richest inheritance.
<BR><B>Ruth E Renkel</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Lucky that man whose children make his happiness in life and not his grief, the anguished disappointment of his hopes. 
<BR><B>Euripedes</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm a father; that's what matters most. Nothing matters more.
<BR><B>Gordon Brown</B>
<BR>
<BR>
There will always be a few people who have the courage to love what is untamed inside us. One of those men is my father. 
<BR><B>Alison Lohman</B>
<BR>
<BR>
If the past cannot teach the present and the father cannot teach the son, then history need not have bothered to go on, and the world has wasted a great deal of time. 
<BR><B>Russell Hoban</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Dad, wherever you are, you are gone but you will never be forgotten.
<BR><B>Conrad Hall</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The father is always a Republican toward his son, and his mother's always a Democrat. 
<BR><B>Robert Frost</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Never raise your hand to your kids.  It leaves your groin unprotected.  
<BR><B>Red Buttons</B>
<BR>
<BR>
My father always used to say that when you die, if you've got five real friends, you've had a great life. 
<BR><B>Elbert Hubbard</B>
<BR>
<BR>

My father always told me, 'Find a job you love and you'll never have to work a day in your life.’ 
<BR><B>Jim Fox</B>

When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.
<BR><B>Mark Twain</B>
<BR>
<BR>
To be as good as our fathers we must be better, imitation is not discipleship.
<BR><B>Wendell Phillips</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Sherman made the terrible discovery that men make about their fathers sooner or later… that the man before him was not an aging father but a boy, a boy much like himself, a boy who grew up and had a child of his own and, as best he could, out of a sense of duty and, perhaps love, adopted a role called Being a Father so that his child would have something mythical and infinitely important: a Protector, who would keep a lid on all the chaotic and catastrophic possibilities of life.  
<BR><B>Tom Wolfe</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The father of a daughter is nothing but a high-class hostage. A father turns a stony face to his sons, berates them, shakes his antlers, paws the ground, snorts, runs them off into the underbrush, but when his daughter puts her arm over his shoulder and says, 'Daddy, I need to ask you something,' he is a pat of butter in a hot frying pan. 
<BR><B>Garrison Keillor</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Any man can be a father but it takes someone special to be a dad.
<BR><B>Anne Geddes</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I would want my legacy to be that I was a great son, father and friend.
<BR><B>Dante Hall</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Good fathers make good sons.
<BR><B>Anonymous</B>
<BR>
<BR>
My father said, 'Politics asks the question: Is it expedient? Vanity asks: Is it popular? But conscience asks: Is it right? 
<BR><B>Dexter Scott King</B>
<BR>
<BR>
A truly rich man is one whose children run into his arms when his hands are empty.
<BR><B>Anonymous</B>
