<BR>
<BR> 
[In September 2008.] You don't have to try to be the first guy to pounce on the opportunity.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2009 on whether he is going to leave when he was at TCW.] People are in a dark room, looking for a black cat that isn't there and finding it.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010.] I am amazingly brilliant analytically.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2010.] You don't go from a trainee to managing director in seven years. I was running the most important department at the firm, but the firm didn't like the fact that I was growing so much.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2010.] In one way, it's nice to run less money.  [But] I like to think of myself as a big-time bond-fund manager.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2010 after he was fired why didn’t he take time off but setup DoubleLine.] I had no choice. Within hours of being kicked out, many of the people who worked for me called up, and clearly, it was the case they wanted to leave and do whatever I was doing. From the other side, clients were calling me saying, "What's going on?" People came over to my house. There was an assumption we're going to continue to work together.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2010.] At TCW, every investment department is a firm upon itself. We did our own compliance, marketing, distribution, created the strategies and built the system with little support from TCW.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2010.] We had to focus on investors. Investors care about returns... If we provide premium returns, they invest.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2010.] Virtually everyone here will own part of the firm.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2010.] It's more fun to build a firm. It's exciting. You can't buy this kind of excitement.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In June 2010.] You can't make many mistakes. It's like the Super Bowl. You're a great team, but you have a challenge in front of you. If you start by fumbling the ball, you're going to lose. We can make a few mistakes, and we will. But you have to minimize the mistakes.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2010 on a tip for staying calm in money management.] Yoga. I'm not very good at it but have been doing it for about five years.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2010.] People don't want to hear this. We're in the second phase of this credit crisis. Our debt burden has shifted from the individual to the government. It will work temporarily as you live on Miracle Gro and a sugar high, but when it runs out, then the economy will be in trouble again.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2010.] People say a correction is a 10% decline and a bear market is 20%. But a bear market is when people stop cooperating. The key example is Greece. Fundamentally, we're in a bear market, based on non-cooperation. It's all wrapped up in debt.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2010.] The next several years will be one of the most difficult periods we'll face in our investing careers. This is a time for preservation of wealth.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2010.] People have been living on borrowed money to aspire to a lifestyle beyond their means. Now we have to pay the price.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2010.] Right now, the economy is living on government stimulus.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2010.] My base case is either austerity now or we hit the wall with a debt crisis of our own later. Be prepared for much lower investment returns.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2010.] If Treasuries, which should rally on recessionary news, sell off on economic weakness, you must act decisively and sell. For investors who require a higher-yield alternative to government issues, I would recommend Ginnie Mae bonds. Ginnie Mae pass-throughs yield more than comparable-maturity Treasuries and, unlike corporate bonds, have no default risk.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In October 2010.] I can be charming, I can be uncharming.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In October 2010.] It's fun to manage $5 billion. If you manage $70 billion, you're going to have to say 'yes' to the marginal securities.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2010 on a TCW claim.] Our superior investment results relative to those generated by TCW this year are a priori proof of the false nature of TCW's claim.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2011.] Look, I have a gift, or some would say a curse, of being able to have stunning insight into the reality of markets and the economy.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2011.] I don't often know where my ideas come from. Maybe it's the fact that I'm obsessively regimented in my analysis, borderline autistic. But whether it's bond selection or asset allocation, we can do it better than just about anybody around.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2011.] Though I rarely go public with specifics on stocks, I think the Standard & Poor's 500, which is now over 1300, will hit 500 in the next couple of years.  I usually couch my belief by saying merely that 2011 will be a tough year for equities.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2011.] Look, I don't know whether the market will suffer $10 billion or $30 billion in defaults, but the actual amount doesn't matter.  There will be a panic at the margin, and muni bonds from the highest-rated on down will plummet, in part because other sorts of investors tend not to step in.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2011.] There's little doubt Congress will raise the debt ceiling.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012.] This is a bad time to be deploying money into risk assets.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012.] What happens when the stimulus Ends?
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2012.] What if inflation becomes a problem?
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In October 2012.] The next 30 years are not going to be the same.  If instead we go into opposite trend and have debt paid down, the government is not running deficits and [see] rising interest rates potentially, then everything is backwards.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012.] Lower interest rates are leading to a lack of job creation for young people.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012 on ECB President Mario Draghi’s promise that officials will do enough to save the Euro.] I’m very skeptical that will prove to be the case.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012.] Now is the German society willing to pay the debts of the periphery and disgorge the benefits it received over time?
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012.] There’s no surplus in the government or public economy.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012.] If you want to talk about paying for things using surpluses built up in the past, there are two places to get it: in corporations and the vaults of rich people. You may not like it. I don’t know how you can get away from that fact.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012 on Apple Inc.  One] Of the most over-believed companies in the world.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012.] One of the most over-believed economies in the world is China. People think it’s superhuman because it’s an autocratic state.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2013.] I was wrong.  I didn't anticipate the magnitude of the liquidation phase in the bond market. I have thought that the 10-year yield should be below 2.5%.  Relative value favored Treasurys before this sell-off. That's why Treasurys have out-performed. Now relative value favors asset classes other than Treasurys.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2013.] I am wrong 30% of the time and right 70% of the time and this was one that was wrong.
