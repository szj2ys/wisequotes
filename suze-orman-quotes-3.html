<BR>
<BR>
Money is not a person you can write out of your life.  You need money to live.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
How we behave toward our money, how we treat our money, speaks volumes about how we perceive and value ourselves.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Respecting your relationship with money… is the key not only to your security and independence, but to your happiness, as well.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Nothing more directly affects your happiness than money.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Silence leads to inaction.

<BR>
<BR>
How are we supposed to teach our children, how are we supposed to educate ourselves, if there isn’t a free and frank flow of information about money?
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If we persist in denying money its place in our lives, if we don’t give it the respect it most certainly deserves, then it will surely lead to unhappiness.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There isn’t a part of our lives that money doesn’t touch…
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most of us, I think, have a core of anxiety that we carry around with us, though we may not admit it to ourselves.  That is part of money’s power over us.

Your money will work for you, and you will always have enough – more than enough – when you give it energy, time and understanding.  
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Money is very much like a person, and it will respond when you treat it as you would a cherished friend – never fearing it, pushing it away, pretending it doesn’t exist, or turning away from its needs, never clutching it so hard that it hurts.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Your own memories about money will tell you a lot, if you take that step back and see what those memories are still telling you who you are today.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Fears hate more than anything else to be defeated.  Fears will always tell you what you can’t do, not what you can do.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Your actions are dictated by the choices you make.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>

Two of life’s greatest pleasures: counting your money as it grows and dreaming you’ll spend it when the time comes.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Be open to receive all that you are meant to have.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Money like every other living thing, isn’t always going to behave in ways you can predict.  Sometimes you’ll have more than you expected, and at other times, money will flow out and you’ll have less than you thought.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On her father] After his little chicken shack had burned to the ground, my dad was penniless.  Because he wasn’t properly insured, everything was a total loss, and he had absolutely no money to start up another business.  His health was suffering, too; he had gotten emphysema from all the smoke he inhaled in the fire.  It was a very hard time in our family.
<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We cannot measure our self-worth by our net worth.  True wealth is that which can never diminish.

<BR><a href="suze-orman-quotes.html">Suze Orman<a/>
