Free markets can be harsh taskmasters, but… the free market may be a lousy system, but it just happens to be the best one we’ve got.

When Sir John Templeton asked me to manage the first emerging markets fund in 1987, a universally accepted operational definition of an emerging market did not exist.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Emerging markets are the financial markets of economies that are in the growth stage of their development cycle and have low to middle per capita incomes.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Stock market expansion allows for greater movement in stock values.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Taking a long view of emerging markets will yield excellent results for the investor prepared to be patient and willing to apply sound and tested principles in a diligent and consistent manner.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When visiting the countries in which I invest I like to talk to working people and people who are actually functioning in the economy.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t panic.  Panic… is an irrational visceral response to a sense of powerlessness and helplessness, which often comes from a lack of understanding of the actual circumstances.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The main reason we felt positive was because all of the trends were so negative.  This was not just to be stubbornly or rigidly contrarian – because being a true contrarian means not to go slavishly against the grain, but to be always independent in your thinking.  It was simply that we and the short-term smart money were operating according to different time frames.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If the whole world is avoiding a country for exaggerated, short-term reasons, think of shifting it from a hold to a buy.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>

It is not always possible to predict whether a company is going to be successful or unsuccessful, so it is necessary to diversify.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>

<BR>
It stands to reason that the more time and effort that are put into researching investments, the more knowledge that will be gained and wiser decisions made.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>

Taking risks is the best way investors can make profits.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>

The inherent risk of putting too many eggs in one basket.  I learned that it was actually possible to have all your eggs in the wrong basket at the wrong time.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2011] These days, I spend at least 300 out of every 365 days either on the road, or in the air.  For most people forced to endure it, homelessness is the ultimate sacrifice.

There is no simple secret, no single blueprint, no rigid road map, that will guarantee you – or me – long-term success as a global investor.  But there are, of course, plenty of good, solid lessons to be learned from observing the methods of research and analysis employed by a long-term investor in these famously turbulent markets.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
All investing involves risk… Emerging markets investing is no different.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the most experienced investor cannot guarantee future investment results.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Frontier markets are generally under-researched.  They thus tend to be ignored by the majority of investors.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In one month, approximately 30,000 company research reports are produced in the United States by brokers, banks and other organizations.  In Nigeria, it is less than 100.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Small things like how modern the airport is, the efficiency of public transportation, how crowded a restaurant or hotel might be, how many tourists there are, can tell you a lot about the city.

<BR>
Always have an exit strategy.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Only when the odds are against you are you going to find any real bargains.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The people behind the company are just as important as the numbers.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Never assume that the law is on your side.  The law in some emerging markets may not be able to protect you.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If things turn sour for a company and it begins to lose money, the loss may be an opportunity for you to get in, but you must investigate very, very carefully.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If the management or majority owner doesn’t want to meet with you, watch out.  They’ve probably got something to hide.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In emerging markets investments, it is necessary to be optimistic since the world belongs to optimists; the pessimists are only spectators.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Although some of the stock markets of developing nations may sometimes seem ‘submerged,’ they are generally emerging into bigger and better things.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
All the clients were saying. [In 1987]  ‘Get invested!  Get invested!  The markets are going up!’  And of course, being value investors we took our sweet time.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We saw these markets rising and said to ourselves.  ‘Now, wait a minute.  Unless profits are skyrocketing, the values are decreasing.’  So we arrived in October of ’87 with 30% of assets in cash.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Depreciation policy can turn a profit into a loss very quickly.  So we have to look at real earnings and cash flow.  But we never come up with absolute answers.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The problem is that people don’t have a long time frame.  
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1994] Ninety percent of the time we see the management before buying.  Every once in a while the numbers may look so tempting on a stock that we begin nibbling at its shares.  But we won’t load up until we’ve seen the company.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On what convinces him to sell a stock] When we find something cheaper.  That’s the theory.  In reality, what happens is that you sell something to buy that cheap stock, and when you arrive with cash in had, it’s not there at the price you thought you could get it for.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As value investors, it’s almost a given that we’ll have lots of cash, even though we don’t plan it that way.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There’s no good reason to buy unless you can double your money… However long it takes.  Waiting doesn’t bother me.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Emerging markets were very cheap at the end of 2008.  I did not envision stock prices going so low.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010] In my opinion, the future is the euro.  There will be an inexorable move to the single currency.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You have to look at the future, not just at today.
<BR><a href="mark-mobius-quotes.html">Mark Mobius<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Perspiration more than inspiration.
