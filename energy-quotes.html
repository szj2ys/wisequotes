Energy is a bit like money: if you have a positive balance, you can distribute it in various ways, but according to the classical laws that were believed at the beginning of the century, you weren’t allowed to be overdrawn.
<BR><a href="stephen-hawking-quotes.html">Stephen Hawking<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
I never considered my dreams wasted energy; they were invariably linked to some form of action. When I dreamed about having a lemonade stand, for example, it wasn’t long before I set up a lemonade stand.

Age is only a number, a cipher for the records.  A man can’t retire his experience.  He must use it.  Experience achieves more with less energy and time.
<BR><B>Bernard Baruch</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Love is energy of life. 
<BR><B>Robert Browning</B>

<BR><B>Sarah Bernhardt</B>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><B>Frank Shorter</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Love the moment, and the energy of that moment will spread beyond all boundaries.
<BR><B>Corita Kent</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm starting to believe that happily ever after includes people doing things that upset each other. We all get cranky, or impatient, or worried, or careless enough to do or say things that hurt someone else. Like it or not, that's normal. We can't blame it all on Olympia's bad energy. The important part is that we feel sorry about what we've done and make up for it. That's something Olympia never did.
<BR><B>Jean Ferris</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Crime is naught but misdirected energy.
<BR><B>Emma Goldman</B>
 <BR>
<BR>
When mental energy is allowed to follow the line of least resistance and to fall into easy channels, it is called weakness. 
<BR><B>James Allen</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Energy is the power that drives every human being.  It is not lost by exertion but maintained by it, for it is a faculty of the psyche.
<BR><B>Germaine Greer</B>
<BR>
<BR>
When you die, the energy that kept you alive filters into the people you loved. Did you know that? It's like a fire you've tended all your life, and the sparks are all scattered into the wind.... That's why we survive as long as we do, because the people who loved us keep us going.
<BR><B>Kevin Brockmeier</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
Our energy is in proportion to the resistance it meets.
<BR><B>William Hazlitt</B>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I do believe we're all connected. I do believe in positive energy. I do believe in the power of prayer. I do believe in putting good out into the world. And I believe in taking care of each other. 
<BR><B>Harvey Fierstein</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
What lies behind us, and what lies before us are small matters compared to what lies within us.
<BR><B>Ralph Waldo Emerson</B>
<BR>
<BR>
When love first happens, the individuals are giving each other energy unconsciously and both people feel buoyant and elated. That's the incredible high we call being ‘in love.’ Unfortunately, once they expect this feeling to come from another person, they cut themselves off from the energy in the universe and begin to rely even more on the energy from each other--only now there doesn’t seem to be enough and so they stop giving each other energy and fall back into their dramas in an attempt to control each other and force the other’s energy their way. 
<BR><B>James Redfield</B>
<BR>
<BR>
To be awake is to be alive
<BR><B>Henry David Thoreau</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The happiest part of a man’s life is what he passes lying awake in bed in the morning.
<BR><B>Samuel Johnson</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
When we dislike someone, or feel threatened by someone, the natural tendency is to focus on something we dislike about the person, something that irritates us. Unfortunately, when we do this--instead of seeing the deeper beauty of the person and giving them energy--we take energy away and actually do them harm. All they know is that they suddenly feel less beautiful and less confident, and it is because we sapped their energy. 
<BR><B>James Redfield</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.
<BR><B>Carl Gustav Jung</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Thoughts create a new heaven, a new firmament, a new source of energy, from which new arts flow.
<BR><B>Philipus Aureolus Paracelsus</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.
<BR><B>Plutarch</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Energy and persistence conquer all things. 
<BR><B>Benjamin Franklin</B>
