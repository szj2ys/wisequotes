<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2008] I don’t think you can really have our historic standard of living if what the economy consists of is flipping hamburgers, swapping pieces of paper on the stock market, and suing each other.
<BR><a href="wilbur-ross-quotes.html">Wilbur Ross<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 2010] What changes the price of anything that trades is the last few percentage points of the trade.  It isn’t the 99 percent that doesn’t trade.

<BR><a href="wilbur-ross-quotes.html">Wilbur Ross<a/>

<BR>
[In October 2007] I don’t think you can ever legislate people against making foolish loans… In terms of solving the problem of people who simply can’t pay, it’s not terribly clear to me what they can do to help them.  Somebody has to take the loss.

<BR>
<BR>
[On originally doing an English course that he hoped would prepare him to have a career as a creative writer.] Every single day, you had to submit 1,000 words of fiction or poetry that you had created… Every day… And I found that after about two weeks, I didn’t have any more material.

[On dropping out of creative writing.] It turns out it probably saved me from a life of poverty anyway.
<BR><a href="wilbur-ross-quotes.html">Wilbur Ross<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think one thing that thinking about writing and trying to get your thoughts together, particularly in a limited space like 1,000 words, is to organize your thought process, organize your questions, and think through what your observations are.  So I think those are all good disciplines for any kind of analytical activity.
<BR><a href="wilbur-ross-quotes.html">Wilbur Ross<a/>

One of the problems with industries that have been in relatively long-term declines is that very often, the managements in those industries develop a kind of loser mentality.  And when you ask them what’s wrong with the business, they’ll point to extraneous forces.  It’s be the fault of the unions, or it’ll be the fault of China or the fault of the government or the fault of the class-action people.  So rather than dealing with things that may be within their own control, they kind of sit around sulking about things that are fundamentally out of their control.
<BR><a href="wilbur-ross-quotes.html">Wilbur Ross<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think good ideas really are simple ideas, at least in retrospective.
<BR><a href="wilbur-ross-quotes.html">Wilbur Ross<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2008] The main thing isn't so much the idea. It's important to have a sound idea, but the really important thing is the implementation. I have a little pin cushion that says on it a very important saying, and that is, ‘I'd rather back a mediocre idea that was brilliantly executed than a brilliant idea that was poorly executed.’
<BR><a href="wilbur-ross-quotes.html">Wilbur Ross<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2008] It's not just the idea. The idea is, in a sense, the easier part if you're careful. The harder part is implementation. And that's what really makes or breaks any of these things.
<BR><a href="wilbur-ross-quotes.html">Wilbur Ross<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2008] You don't need to have a global recession in order to find things that make sense to do.
