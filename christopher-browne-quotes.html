Value investors are more like farmers.  They plant seeds and wait for the crops to grow.  If the corn is a little late in starting because of cold weather, they don’t tear up the fields and plant something else.  No, they just sit back and wait patiently for the corn to pop out of the ground, confident that it will eventually sprout.

<BR>
<BR>
In more than 35 years in the investment business, I have yet to find a short-term timing strategy that works.  
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Value investing is the stress-free route to investment success.  
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
First rule of investing: Don’t lose money.  Second rule of investing: Refer to rule number one.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Buy when the insiders buy.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The time to buy stocks is when they are on sale, and not when they are high priced because everyone wants to own them.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I always try to buy stocks on sale, no matter where the sale is.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Buying stocks when they are cheap has for me been the best way to grow my money.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Risk is more often in the price you pay than in the stock itself.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On trying to predict future exchange rate moves like in FX trading.] Trying to figure what the Italian lira was going to do versus the Spanish paseta versus the U.S. dollar would have been a challenge [even] for Einstein.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I like to stay within my circle of competence.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Value investing is straight forward; it does not require a superhuman set of brain cells.  The average person can understand the logic of it all.  Buy a dollar for 60 cents from some unsuspecting seller and wait until the person wants it back for a dollar.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Sex sells even in the stock market, and everyone wants to own the latest sexy issue.  Value stocks are about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  But have you ever noticed just how much your grass grows in a week?
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most people seek immediate gratification in almost everything they do including investing.  When most investors buy a stock, they expect it to go up immediately.  If it doesn’t, they sell it and buy something else.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Buy stocks as you would groceries – when they are on sale.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You need to invest but you don’t need to be a genius to do it smartly.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You are who you meet.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Buy stocks like you buy everything else, when they are on sale.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Value investing is more like a long trip to a pleasant destination than a ride on a roller coaster.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I like to think of Tweedy [Browne] as the Vatican City of value investing, and although we do not have a pope, we have great cardinals and bishops.  Walter Schloss has hung his hat at Tweedy since 1954 and at 89 is someone who can definitely be called a legend of the investment world.

<BR>
Sensible investing, which can be found in the art and science of the tenets of value investing, is not rocket science.  
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Value investing is not the new-new.  It is, in fact, the old-old.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Value investing is not a set of hard-and-fast rules.  It is a set of principles that form a philosophy of investing.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As Warren Buffett has said, no more than 125 IQ points are needed to be a successful investor.  Any more and they are wasted.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Tweedy, Browne had the advantage of being broker to three of the most outstanding investors in history: Benjamin Graham, Walter Schloss, and Warren Buffett.  No wonder we are committed value investors.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Think of the search for value stocks like grocery shopping for the highest quality goods at the best possible price.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What’s it worth?  - Think like a banker.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The lower the price, the higher the return.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Buy a buck for 66 cents.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is a global search for value.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Seek and you shall find.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Currencies confuse even the experts.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s a marathon, not a sprint.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s time in the market, not market timing, that counts.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most people tend to look at pretty much everything they buy with an eye on the value they get for the price they pay.  When prices drop, they buy more of the things they want and need.  Except in the stock market…
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When stocks climb, Wall Street research reports scream BUY.  When stocks fall, the experts tell us to HOLD when they really mean SELL.  (Sell is considered impolite in the world of stocks except under the most extreme circumstances.)  Everyone seems to think they should buy stocks that are rising and sell those that are falling.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s not just everyday, individual investors who fall prey to the herd mentality; it also happens to professional portfolio managers.  If they own the same stocks everyone else owns, they are unlikely to be fired if the stocks go down.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is nothing wrong with owning great businesses that can grow at fast rates.  The fault in this approach lies in the price that investors pay.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Stocks on sale will give you more value in return for your dollars.
<BR><a href="christopher-browne-quotes.html">Christopher Browne<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The beauty of value investing is its logical simplicity.  It is based on two principles: What’s it worth (intrinsic value), and don’t lose money (margin of safety).
