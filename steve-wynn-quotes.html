<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>

He said, ‘Steve, Steve, ya gotta nice sign, but Steve, Steve, Steve, ya gotta do something with water.’  [Steve then did something with water.]
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I can tell you that there are no suckers in a casino.  It implies ignorance, and more importantly it implies that there’s a predator involved, which has to be me.  All you’ve got to do is find one customer at the Mirage who can’t tell you that the house is against him; find one person there who’s there to make a living, who thinks that they can win in the casino as a matter of fact as opposed to being pure luck… These people are here for diversion.
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

The most horrible thing about this and the reason I hate to discuss it is someone will say, ‘Oh, I heard about your eyes.’  I’m about as pathetic or sympathetic a character as Attila the Hun.
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On casinos in the early 90’s] The old joints are going into the toilet, but the new ones are all fresh and lively.  Recession?  Money coming by the billion.  Two billion is being spent here [in his three casinos] this year.
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father having passed away] I’d give up everything for fifteen minutes with my father.  To have him walk through this hotel and see what happened.  No you’re talking about something more than a big number.  I miss the thrill of showing my dad that it worked out OK.  He would have been awful proud.
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On having to take over his father’s floundering bingo business and him reading the bingo numbers.  It was not just bingo, he was selling] It was making the bingo a social recreational experience.
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In the late 1980s] It was my growing feeling that Las Vegas had a terrible kind of sameness to it.  Boxes of rooms on top of rooms filled with slot machines.  I’m not a gambler.  I wouldn’t go across the street to shoot dice except as a lark maybe twice a year.  But I’d go regularly to see a wonderment or a new attraction.  So would you.
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
[On him and his wife divorcing and then remarrying] The divorce just didn’t work out.
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We’re in the entertainment and leisure recreational business: Give the people what they want, and even if there’s a casino on both sides of you, they’ll come to your place.  Trust a slot machine, and you’re [screwed] if there’s another slot machine.  If you’re the only guy [gambling operator] in town, you’re gonna look like a rocket scientist.  
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The strongest force in this earth is something that affects your self-esteem.  
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>

<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On whether he knew of any gambling customer who was consistently making money in one of his casinos] Nope.
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On paying attention to all the fine details and how it looks in his casino’s] I can’t help myself.  It’s a sickness.
<BR><a href="steve-wynn-quotes.html">Steve Wynn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On accidentally putting a tear in a $138 million dollar Picasso painting] But the fact of the matter what stands historically is that the painting was damaged by it’s owner, the cluzo of collectors, Wynn.  But look how people make mistakes.
