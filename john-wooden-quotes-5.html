You can’t make up for a poor effort today by giving 110 percent tomorrow. You don’t have 110 percent. You only have 100 percent, and that’s what I want from you right now.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> I prefer to give a ‘pat on the back’ as a motivational tool, although sometimes the patmust be a little lower and a little harder.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> You can always do more than you think you can.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> Each member of your team has the potential for personal greatness; the leader’s job is to help them achieve it.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>Be ready and your chance may come.

You never stop trying.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> For maximum team accomplishment, each individual must prepare himself to the best of his ability and then put his talent to work for the team. This must be done unselfishly, without thought of personal glory. When no one worries about who will receive the credit, far more can be accomplished in any group activity.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> I’m asked, “Coach Wooden, how did you win all those championships?” My response is factual: “I didn’t win all those championships. Our team did.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> I must caution you that you cannot live in the past. The 1971–72 season is now history, and we must look toward the future. The past cannot change what is to come. The work that you do each and every day is the only true way to improve andprepare yourself for what is to come. You cannot change the past, but you can influence the future by what you do today.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> The past cannot change what is to come.

Pride has first place.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> If I do not feel there is a place where you can contribute, I would not want to waste your time, and if you do not feel that you are part of the team as a whole, then you should drop out. Although I prefer to go too far with a play rather than not far enough, I will drop you when I feel certain that you are wasting your time.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>There is much truth in Kipling’s “Law of the Jungle” where he says, “The strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack.” If you discipline yourself toward team effort under the supervision of the coach, even though you may not always agree with my decisions, much can and will be accomplished. As someone once said, “You will be amazed at how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> Come in and talk to me whenever you feel like it, but please remember that it isn’t necessarily lack of communication if we fail to agree on your position or another individual on the team. I am and will always be interested in your problems, but I do feel that everyone should do everything possible to work out their own problems rather than become dependent upon others. I have found prayer most helpful when I am troubled, and I believe that all prayers are heard and answered, even though the answer may be “no.”<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> Get even by scoring.  Get even by winning.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> A leader is wise to remember that a big producer is assisted by a big team.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> My experience in teaching and coaching over many years has naturally caused me to become somewhat opinionated in certain areas, but even most of those who are inexperienced will agree that experience is a great, although sometimes hard, teacher.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> The ancient proverb says, “Crisis presents opportunity.” It is the opportunity to dig deeper and rise higher; to get stronger and be smarter; to find a better way, a different path. Adversity offers the opportunity, but  you must recognize it.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> It has been almost four months since our basketball season came to a close. It was a very successful season [UCLA had won its sixth national championship in seven years], but it is now history and we must look toward the future. The past cannot change what is to come. It is what you do today that counts, and I sincerely hope that you are looking forward to an outstanding 1970–71 season and are eager, not just willing, to make the necessary personal sacrifices to reach that goal. All worthwhile accomplishments require sacrifice and hard work.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> Fellas, we’ve got to play at our best. Let’s do that.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> Does anybody here remember who was the runner-up in last year’s national championship?<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> Fellas, I want you to become men, not just beat somebody in basketball.<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="john-wooden-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="john-wooden-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="john-wooden-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="john-wooden-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="john-wooden-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="john-wooden-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="john-wooden-quotes-8.html">8<a/> </p><p><BR>
