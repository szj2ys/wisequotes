[In August 2013.] Integrity is of paramount importance in good leadership.  It goes beyond how you conduct yourself. It’s also about how you communicate. You show respect by bringing a lot of candour to situations.
 <BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2013 on originally joining PriceWaterhouseCooper after graduation.] With a degree in accounting, the logical next step was to become a CA (chartered accountant) but I was always trying to develop my technical skills... and after moving to California I saw a great emphasis on communication and writing skills.

<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2013 on being hired after PriceWaterhouseCooper by one of his customers CalEnergy which was later acquired by MidAmerican.] My energy background from Alberta was relevant, and while I was happy to join them on the financial side, in a short time I wanted to become more involved in the operational side.  I was an accountant who wanted to be in the field, and I spent a year at their geothermal power plant at Ridgecrest, two hours east of Los Angeles.

<BR>
[In September 2013 on the University of Alberta where he studied.] I think the university really did challenge us in a lot of different ways and of course we still today to question challenge, be a critical thinker.  Those are realistically a variety of skills I still pull out daily and utilise in my daily worklife and I believe it’s benefited me both professionally and personally.

<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>

<BR>
Bonus
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2015 on Greg Abel.] Under this Buffett-soon-leaves assumption, his successors would not be ‘of only moderate ability.’  For instance, <a href="ajit-jain-quotes.html">Ajit Jain<a/> and Greg Abel are proven performers who would probably be under-described as ‘world-class.’  ‘World-leading’ would be the description I would choose.  In some important ways, each is a better business executive than Buffett.  And I believe neither Jain nor Abel would (1) leave Berkshire, no matter what someone else offered or (2) desire much change in the Berkshire system.
<BR><a href="charlie-munger-quotes.html">Charlie Munger<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I get a lot of phone calls each day, and I always make time for Greg when he calls because he brings me great ideas and is truly innovative in his thinking and business approach.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
For one thing he’s a good friend.  He’s the sort of person you can count on to take care of anything that comes up and to take care of your interests as well as his own.  He’s a first class human being and there’s a lot of smart people in this world but some of them do some very dumb things.  He’s a smart guy who will never do a dumb thing.  I’ve never heard him say anything that didn’t make sense.  So when we’re talking about a deal it’s easy, he sees that essence of it and puts it all together and then if we do something with it he runs it right.  That’s enormously important.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 2008 on Greg Abel becoming the CEO of MidAmerican.] Greg Abel and I have worked together for more than 15 years. Greg is one of the finest executives in our industry, and he has the full confidence of Walter Scott Jr., Warren Buffett and I.  Much of MidAmerican's success to date is due to Greg's efforts. We are fortunate to have a leader of Greg's caliber as our partner. <BR><B>David Sokol</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Greg who has an accounting background and rose quickly due to his ability and sharp business acumen.] The business friend relationship normally comes into conflict.  I think the reason that Greg and I can work it out is because we separate our two roles clearly, and we do it openly and knowingly.  For example, we enjoy skiing together, but when we get back to work, we make sure we don’t slack off and expect less of each other because we are friends.  Instead we hold ourselves to much higher standards. <BR><B>David Sokol</B>
<BR>
<BR>
We think as a team and often solicit disagreement, recognizing that it can be very beneficial in making better decisions. - David Sokol
<BR><B>David Sokol</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006 on owning utilities.] Not a way to get rich.  It’s a way to stay rich.
