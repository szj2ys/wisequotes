When I know what I am talking about, I can pursue my goal enthusiastically because self-confidence gives me a clear vision of my goal and creates desire that is strong enough to sweep away almost any obstacles. 
<BR><a href="paul-j-meyer-quotes.html">Paul J Meyer<a/>

<BR><B>Indian Proverb</B>
<BR>

We are two distinct races and must ever remain so. There is little in common between us….Your religion was written on tablets of stone by the iron finger of an angry God, lest you might forget it. The red man could never remember nor comprehend it. Our religion is the traditions of our ancestors, the dreams of our old men, given them by the Great Spirit, and the visions of our sachems, and is written in the hearts of our people.

<BR>

To make a contented slave, you must make a thoughtless one. It is necessary to darken his moral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, to annihilate his power of reason.

And the thing that pleases me most is the fact that you are a very young man and have caught the vision, which means that you are going to keep the progressive fires burning until they act as a leaven and stir up the mass of thinkers, as it is beginning to do already.

<BR><a href="barbara-jordan-quotes.html">Barbara Jordan<a/>
<BR>

A president who faithfully executes the office has a sense of history and a vision for the future. He envisions a society in which all men and women stand on level ground and certain starting places are not favored over others. He sees a society in which all people are free to soar to the upper reaches of their capacities. He sees unfettered opportunities. He trusts government. He does not fear government.

A few years ago the city council of Monza, Italy, barred pet owners from keeping goldfish in curved goldfish bowls. The measure’s sponsor explained the measure in part by saying that it is cruel to keep a fish in a bowl with curved sides because, gazing out, the fish would have a distorted view of reality. But how do we know we have the true, undistorted picture of reality? Might not we ourselves also be inside some big goldfish bowl and have our vision distorted by an enormous lens? The goldfish’s picture of reality is different from ours, but can we be sure it is less real?
<BR><a href="stephen-hawking-quotes.html">Stephen Hawking<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Challenges are everywhere in business… It can be when faced with someone or some organization that doesn’t share the same vision; or it can be when faced with an adversary who wants to restrict your growth or opportunity; it can be internal – about people, or about the corporate structure that can generate the best returns. These challenges are all as important as each other when they arise, but the most important thing is to overcome them and try to move forward. That is the only way forward.
