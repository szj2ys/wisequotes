No f*cking idea what it’s like to be me.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It’s rare that you see an artist in his 30s or 40s able to really contribute something amazing.  Of course, there are some people who are innately curious, forever little kids in their awe of life, but they’re rare.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Your thoughts construct patterns like scaffolding in your mind.  You are really etching chemical patterns.  In most cases, people get stuck in those patterns, just like grooves in a record, and they never get out of them.  I’ll always stay connected with Apple.  I hope that throughout my life I’ll sort of have the thread of my life and the thread of Apple weave in and out of each other, like a tapestry.  There may be a few years when I’m not there, but I’ll always come back….<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>If you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much.  You have to be willing to take whatever you’ve done and whoever you were and throw them away.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The more the outside world tries to reinforce an image of you, the harder it is to continue to be an artist, which is why a lot of times, artists have to say, ‘Bye.  I have to go I’m crazy and I’m getting out of here.’  And they go and hibernate somewhere.  Maybe later they re-emerge a little differently.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>You don’t know what you’re talking about!  The Macintosh team is doing great, and I’m having the best time of my life right now.  You’re just completely out of touch.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>[To Andy Hertzfeld] The Mac team had to grow up, and so do you.  I want you to come back, but if you don’t want to, that’s up to you.  You don’t matter as much as you think you do, anyway.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Burrell Smith urinating on Steve’s desk.  But Steve had heard.] Are you gonna do it?  Are you really gonna do it?  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To Bruce Horn on resigning] Everything that’s wrong with the Mac is your fault.  ‘Well, actually, Steve, a lot of things that are right with the Mac are my fault, and I had to fight like crazy to get those things in.’  You’re right.  I’ll give you 15,000 shares to stay.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I informed them, that working with Woz wouldn’t be acceptable to us.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It’s not personal.  We don’t want to see our design language used on other products.  Woz has to find his own resources.  He can’t leverage off Apple’s resources; we can’t treat him specially.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I tried to educate him [John Sculley] about the details of engineering, but he had no idea how products are created, and after a while it just turned into arguments.  But I learned that my perspective was right.  Products are everything.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To Xerox’s vice chair Bill Glavin] You guys don’t have any clue what you’re doing. <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’m sorry, but I couldn’t help myself.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I will not criticize the rest of the organization, I will not criticize the rest of the organization…<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To John Sculley] You’ve got to spend more time with me.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>[On John Sculley saying he’s going to recommend Jobs step down from running the Macintosh division] I don’t believe you’re going to do that.  If you do that, you’re going to destroy the company.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To John Sculley] You’re terrific, and I just want you to know I love working with you.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Why did John [Sculley] do this to me?  He betrayed me.  John’s friendship is more important than anything else, and I think maybe that’s what I should do, concentrate on our friendship.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To John Sculley] I think you really lost your stride.  You were really great the first year, and everything went wonderful.  But something happened.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’m going to launch a coup while John [Sculley] is in China.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I made the mistake of telling Gassee.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To John Sculley] I think you’re bad for Apple, and I think you’re the wrong person to run the company.  You really should leave this company.  You don’t know how to operate and never have.  I wanted you here to help me grow, and you’ve been ineffective in helping me.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I guess I know where things stand.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To John Sculley] Why don’t you become chairman and I’ll become president and chief executive officer?  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It is.  It’s over.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>No, it’s worse.  It’s much worse than you can imagine.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I felt like I’d been punched, the air knocked out of me and I couldn’t breathe.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Arthur [Rock] had been like a father to me.  He took me under his wing.  I remember driving into San Francisco one time, and I said to him, ‘God, that Bank of America building is ugly,’  and he said, ‘No, it’s the best,’ and he proceeded to lecture me, and he was right of course.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>He [Arthur Rock] chose Scully over me.  That really threw me for a loop.  I never thought he would abandon me.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The board felt that I couldn’t run a company, and that was their decision to make.  But they made one mistake.  They should have separated the decision of what to do with me and what to do with Sculley.  They should have fired Sculley, even if they didn’t think I was ready to run Apple.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>How could you suggest this violates American law when it so obviously benefits our interests?  By putting Macs in the hands of Russians, they could print all their newspapers.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On experiments with DNA] Why don’t you simulate them on a computer?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’ve been thinking a lot, and it’s time for me to get on with my life.  It’s obvious that I’ve got to do something.  I’m thirty years old.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Don’t get upset.  These are very low-level people that you won’t miss, and they will be leaving anyway.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To John Sculley on him saying they were not low-level people] Well, these people were going to resign anyway.  They are going to be handing in their resignations by nine this morning.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-16.html">16<a/> </p><p><BR>
