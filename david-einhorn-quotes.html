People say things in the market that they don’t believe to be true both in promoting stocks and rejecting stocks.

I was never a believer that the markets are efficient.

We can't change the course of events, but we can attempt to protect capital in the face of foreseeable risks.

[In November 2007 about whether it was time to start bottom-fishing among financial stocks] You don’t have to be a hero.

[In April 2008] One of the things I have observed is that American financial markets have a very low pain threshold.

When you leave a good job to go off on your own and don’t expect to make money for a while, you name the firm whatever your wife says you should.

The lesson of Lehman should not be that the government should have prevented its failure.  The lesson of Lehman should be that Lehman should not have existed at a scale that allowed it to jeopardize the financial system.

A Jelly Donut is a yummy mid-afternoon energy boost.  Two Jelly Donuts are an indulgent breakfast.  Three Jelly Donuts may induce a tummy ache.  Six Jelly Donuts - that's an eating disorder.  Twelve Jelly Donuts is fraternity pledge hazing.  My point is that you can have too much of a good thing and overdoses are destructive.  Chairman Bernanke is presently force-feeding us what seems like the 36th Jelly Donut of easy money and wondering why it isn't giving us energy or making us feel better…

As an investor my job is to figure out what will happen rather than what should happen.

I have played rotisserie or fantasy baseball for 22 years. Overall, I’ve won some and I’ve lost some. It wouldn’t surprise any of you, that I am usually a value buyer of players.

When people ask me what I do for a living, I generally tell them ‘I run a hedge fund.’ The majority give me a strange look, so I quickly add, ‘I am a money manager.’ When the strange look persists, as it often does, I correct it to simply, ‘I’m an investor.’ Everyone knows what that is.

When people ask me what I did on my summer vacation, I generally tell them ‘I played in the World Series of Poker.’ Nobody gives me a strange look.

Investing and poker require similar skills.

I don’t play a lot of hands. But I don’t just wait for the perfect hand. They don’t come up often enough. I try to pick out one or two people at the table I want to play against or who I sense don’t want to play against me.

Any stock investment can turn out to be a loser no matter how large the edge appears.

One of the best investors around, Joel Greenblatt, has written a popular, charming and funny book about investing in great companies at low P/E multiples. To simplify an already simple book, great companies are generally measured as companies that can generate lots of profit without requiring a lot of capital. This means that they have high ROEs.

<BR>
[In April 2008] Investment companies with thirty times leverage are not safe.
<BR><a href="david-einhorn-quotes.html">David Einhorn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
More leverage means more revenues, which means more compensation.  In good times, once they pay out the compensation, overhead and taxes, only a fraction of the incremental revenues fall to the bottom line for shareholders.
<BR><a href="david-einhorn-quotes.html">David Einhorn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A 99% Value-at-Risk calculation does not evaluate what happens in the last one percent… This is like an air bag that works all the time, except when you have a car accident.
<BR><a href="david-einhorn-quotes.html">David Einhorn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In April 2008] The market perceives the rating agencies to be doing much more than they actually do.
<BR><a href="david-einhorn-quotes.html">David Einhorn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The agencies themselves don’t directly misinform the market, but they don’t’ disabuse the market of perceptions – often spread by the rated entities – that the agencies do more than they actually do.  This creates a false sense of security and in times of stress this actually makes the problems worse.  Had the credit rating agencies been doing a reasonable job of disciplining the investment banks – who unfortunately happen to bring the rating agencies lots of other business – then the banks may have been prevented from taking excess risk and the current crisis might have been averted.
<BR><a href="david-einhorn-quotes.html">David Einhorn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The rating agencies remind me of the department of motor vehicles in that they are understaffed and don’t pay enough to attract the best and the brightest.
<BR><a href="david-einhorn-quotes.html">David Einhorn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Bear [Sterns] didn’t fall because of market rumors.  It fell because it was too levered and had too many illiquid assets of questionable value and at the same time depended on short-term funding.
<BR><a href="david-einhorn-quotes.html">David Einhorn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
While Value-at-Risk might make sense to the quants, it has led to risk taking beyond common sense.

The… question is whether the bail-out was a good idea.  It really comes down to Coke vs. water.  If you are thirsty you have choices.  Coke tastes better and provides an immediate sugar rush and caffeinated stimulus, while quenching thirst.  Water also quenches thirst, but it isn’t as stimulating.  It purifies your body.  It doesn’t make you fat and is much better for your long-term health.

[In April 2008] I’ll offer a few words about Lehman Brothers, another stock which Greenlight is short.  Lehman’s management is charismatic and has almost cult-like status.  Lehman management gets tremendously favorable press for everything from handling the 1998 crisis to supposedly hedging in this crisis to not playing bridge while the franchise implodes… From a balance sheet and business mix perspective, Lehman is not that materially different from Bear Stearns.

My father and grandfather were businessmen.  The family business was Adelphi Paints in New Jersey.  When the first energy crisis came in the early 1970s, the business suffered.  My grandparents decided to sell.  Though my father was a chemist, he worked on the sale of the company.  When it was over he enjoyed the work so much he decided that his future would be in mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

My parents often discussed business at the dinner table.  Like his father, my dad has an enormous reservoir of patience and persistence.  My mom is much more demanding…
<BR><a href="david-einhorn-quotes.html">David Einhorn<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
On my best days, I fancy myself a combination of Dad’s persistence/patience and Mom’s toughness/skepticism.
