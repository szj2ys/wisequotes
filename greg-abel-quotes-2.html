[In December 2011 on buying the US$2 billion dollar Topaz solar farm and due for completion in 2015 and their investment in solar.] Is a strategic move to invest in yet another renewable energy source.

[In December 2011.] MidAmerican is the No. 1 owner of wind-powered energy generation among U.S. rate-regulated utilities. Adding solar energy to our generation portfolio is a strategic move to invest in yet another renewable energy source.  Our investment in wind resources benefits both our customers and the environment, and our entry into the solar energy industry expands our renewable energy footprint and will help meet current and future energy needs in a manner that reflects our ongoing commitment to environmental respect and cost-effective generation.  As energy needs continue to increase, the Topaz project will allow MidAmerican to produce renewable energy for thousands of Californians. This project also demonstrates that solar energy is a commercially viable technology without the support of governmental loan guarantees and reflects the type of solar and other renewable generation that MidAmerican will continue to seek to add to its unregulated portfolio.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2012 on acquiring a 49% interest in the Agua Caliente solar project from NRG Energy.] We are aggressively pursuing opportunities to expand our presence in the renewable energy sector, and the Agua Caliente project is another important step toward that goal.  We look forward to partnering with NRG Energy on this exciting project.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2012.] MidAmerican Renewables is open for business.  We look forward to expanding our wind, geothermal, solar and hydro portfolio, so we can offer energy in the renewables market. We believe the need for renewable energy will continue to grow, and we are excited to be a leader in this area.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

The Bishop Hill II wind project fits our model of investing in the renewable energy sector.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012.] Size matters. If you think about the pressures our customers are under, as they have to become more efficient and effective to sell their product, they're turning to us and saying we have the same expectations of you.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012.] We want to be a buyer of choice. We want to make sure we're bringing something to the table that benefits those stakeholders. They know we can bring stability to that company forever. We bring local management that will never go away, because utilities are local. We bring low-cost capital when they need it. We bring best practices across the business units. Culturally, we want to get it ingrained that we have to become more efficient and effective. We owe it to our customers.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> 
[In September 2012.] The sector is very expensive right now relative to where it traditionally has been. So what you're more likely to see is mergers, share for share exchanges. To go out and buy a company right now is a little more challenging because you really have to think through what the value proposition is when they're at all time high.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012.] We're very proud that in 2015, we're retiring two coal units. It makes more sense for us to retire them than invest in emission controls. But the reality is that when you look at medium and large coals units, it makes sense to still invest in the emission controls so we can meet those standards while continuing to get that low-cost power.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012.] I have to keep challenging the team if they're reaching conclusions that are inconsistent with what other people out there are doing.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012.] We have to continue to find ways to make our existing resources more efficient and more effective. We have that fundamental challenge. It also starts with making the right decision up front.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012.] We have to determine what's the right place to deploy capital.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012.] Energy efficiency is great tool. We're constantly trying to figure out how to mitigate the impact of rate increases. Energy efficiency is absolutely critical and another area where we have to share best practices. Every state has different approaches, but it's the least-cost way to manage resources and we want to find those efficiencies wherever we can.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012.] It's my job to check in on the macro level and ask whether we have inequities in the multi-state protocol and how we start to address them now and not let them continue to build. It can be over energy efficiency or other resources.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012.] If we can ever find a better way to store energy, solar, wind, wave all those things become far more valuable to our investors and customers.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In September 2012.] I like playing with trains.  
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012 on the joint venture with Renewable energy Systems Canada Inc.] This announcement reflects MidAmerican s further commitment to complete electric transmission projects in a timely and cost-effective manner, which will ultimately provide economic benefits to and improve reliability for electric end-use customers.

<BR>
<BR> 
[In October 2012 on TransAlta Corporation entering into a partnership with MidAmerican.] We have been seeking an entry point to the Canadian electricity generation market, where we see strong potential for growth. The partnership will bring two strong development teams together to deliver clean, highly efficient power.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 2012 more on the TransAlta partnership.] We are joining forces with a company that has more than 100 years of history and a well-established reputation for building and operating excellent power projects.   Our two companies also have similar cultures and a shared commitment to safe, reliable operations. The partnership will bring two strong development teams together to deliver clean, highly efficient power to the region.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 2013 on an MOU signed between PacifiCorp and the California Independent System Operator Corp (ISO).] Increased coordination of energy systems in the West is critical if we are to meet important challenges such as ensuring reliability, keeping costs down for customers and effectively integrating renewable resources.  We're hopeful this agreement between PacifiCorp and the ISO signals a significant step toward broader coordination across the West.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>

<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 2013 on thanking Iowa’s congressionals delegation for their strong support of the production tax credit extension.] Iowa’s congressional delegation created the opportunity for this investment through their support at the federal level and continued an environment that makes this type of investment possible.
<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

[In May 2013 on TransAlta Corporation and MidAmerican Transmission creating a new partnership called TAMA Transmission.] MidAmerican Transmission, through this new Canadian partnership, looks forward to the opportunity to participate in this process to help unlock the significant value the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project can bring to Alberta.

<BR><a href="greg-abel-quotes.html">Greg Abel<a/>

<BR>
[In June 2013.] If we wanted to be an energy player in the long run, we needed to capture renewable resources such as wind.  We already had low electricity rates but I did not want to stop there.
