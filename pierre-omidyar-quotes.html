During that first two-year period we were growing 20 to 50 percent every month, every single month.  And some months were 70 percent.  But on that – for two years – sustained growth like that, I don’t think anybody’s, you know, ever done that.

Look at eBay – the idea that in 1995 you could create something over the Internet, which is this brand-new thing that nobody, you know, was really using at the time except for scientists and academics.  And it would be a place where strangers could actually do business with one another, could actually, like exchange merchandise for money, without ever meeting.  You know, and the notion that people could actually buy and sell cars over the Internet, I mean, that’s crazy, right?

[On building the initial eBay code.] It took really just a weekend of work.  And I was working, you know, pretty much all day and all that weekend.  And I think it was Labor Day of 1995, September 4th or 5th, ’95, that I was able to, that morning to basically turn it on.  I’d had it uploaded to my internet service provider, so it was publicly available, turn it on and that was Auction Web.
