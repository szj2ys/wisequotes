What are we to conclude from this unhoped-for development shared between the new radiations revealed to us by science at the end of the nineteenth century? It seems that they must make our confidence in disinterested research more alive and increase our reverence and admiration for it.
<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/>

<BR>
Our machine was designed to be flown as a kite, with a man on board, in winds from 15 to 20 miles an hour. But, upon trial, it was found that much stronger winds were required to lift it. Suitable winds not being plentiful, we found it necessary, in order to test the new balancing system, to fly the machine as a kite without a man on board, operating the levers through cords from the ground. This did not give the practice anticipated, but it inspired confidence in the new system of balance.

[On being sure his rabies vaccine worked on dogs but hesitant on using it on human beings] I have not yet dared to make any attempt upon man, in spite of my confidence as to the result, and in spite of the numerous opportunities that have been offered me since my last lecture at the Academy of Sciences. I am too much afraid of a failure, which may compromise my future plans. I want first to collect a multitude of successful cases of the treatment of animals. In this respect matters are going well. I already have numerous examples of dogs rendered immune after having been bitten. I take two dogs, and I cause them to be bitten by another dog that is mad. I vaccinate one of them, and I leave the other without treatment; the latter dies of hydrophobia; the one that was vaccinated is immune. But, no matter to what extent I should multiply these examples of the prophylaxis of hydrophobia in dogs, it seems to me that my hand would inevitably tremble when the time came to apply the treatment to a human being.

<BR>
<BR> 
Throughout Apollo, everybody I knew was always saying, ‘What if?’ and, ‘Is it possible that this could happen?’ And, ‘What will we do?’ Just that process of continually questioning built your confidence in your ability to handle whatever comes along.
<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/>
<BR>
<BR> The engine performed badly, and after a glide of only 60 feet, the machine came to the ground. Further trial was postponed till the motor could be put in better running condition. The reporters had now, no doubt, lost confidence in the machine, though their reports, in kindness, concealed it. Later, when they heard that we were making flights of several minutes’ duration, knowing that longer flights had been made with airships, and not knowing any essential difference between airships and flying machines, they were but little interested.

Physical activity is part of my lifestyle.  All managers should know to what extent physical exercise, practiced hard, is good not only for the heart, but also for the mind; it gives you a calm sense of confidence in yourself.  And having self-confidence is very important.
<BR><B>Akio Morita</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.
<BR><B>Mahatma Gandhi</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><B>Erma Bombeck</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.
<BR><B>Marcus Aurelius</B>
<BR>
