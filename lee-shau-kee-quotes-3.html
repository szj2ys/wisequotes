[In 2005] The proposed abolishment of estate duty by the Hong Kong Government will contribute to establish Hong Kong as a regional financial centre as well as an asset management hub.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] The Group sold an attributable HK$3,434.6 million worth of properties in Hong Kong as compared with HK$6,810.9 million for the year before.  In light of the then cautious market sentiment, the Group decided to defer the launch of a few new developments…
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] No effort has been spared in ensuring the best designs for all our projects.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2006] Buoyant consumer confidence will continue to underpin retial spending and hence rental growth for shopping centres.  The office market is expected to perform well on the back of tight supply being met by keen demand from companies looking for expansion opportunities.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007 on Henderson Group approach] Our approach as a Group is based on strong economic, social and environmental principles.  We strive to create high quality, visually stimulating innovative new homes and commercial developments that enhance, as well as integrate with, their surrounding natural and built environments.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] Substantial growth in GDP, rising wages, improved employment prospects and favourable bank mortgage terms have all resulted in a buoyant property market.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] The Group is rapidly increasing its activities in Mainland China, where it now has projects ranging from landmark commercial developments in the major cities of Beijing and Shanghai to massive residential schemes in the second-tier cities.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] Boosted by ongoing increases in both its external trade and domestic consumption, mainland China is expected to maintain robust economic growth.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2007] Residential property prices will pick up steadily.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2008] An attributable HK$9,892 million worth of properties in Hong Kong was sold, an increase of 25% as compared with HK$7,895 million for the year before.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2008] The residential leasing market remained robust with expatriates from the banking and financial sectors continuing to be the major source of tenant demand for luxury properties on Hong Kong Island.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2008] The real estate market in mainland China, however, experienced a dramatic change during the past year.  In the second half of 2007, transacted prices in many cities had been repeatedly bid up to all time highs as a result of fierce competition at land auctions.  The subsequent upsurge in housing prices, which were beyond the affordability of the general public, resulted in an overheated property market.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2008] The Group adopts a two-pronged strategy in its business development in mainland China.  In the prime cities, the Group targets those prime sites with heavy pedestrian flow and easy access for development into large-scale complexes of exceptional design and quality.  In the second-tier cities, which are mostly provincial capitals or municipalities with a preponderance of middle class residents, the Group focuses on large-scale developments so as to achieve an efficient use of land as well as long-term appreciation in property value.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2008] The fallout from the US sub-prime issue, turbulence on global financial markets and the resulting credit tightening, slow-down in the global economies and increasing inflationary pressure all threaten to pose a drag on the economic growth in Hong Kong.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2008] The prevailing low mortgage rate, reasonable affordability and the low completion volumes for private-residential units in the coming few years should lend support to the local residential property market.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] The Group also continues to be bullish for the long-term prospects for the property market in mainland China…
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] The profile of homebuyers in Hong Kong is becoming more diverse and a wider range of marketing channels is thus needed to promote the Group’s Hong Kong property projects.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] The onset of global financial turmoil in the second half of 2008 and the resultant wait-and-see attitude adopted by some homebuyers put the property market into the doldrums, with a general decline in both transaction volume and transacted prices.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] In early 2009, the property market was still being driven by pessimistic sentiment and a wait-and-see attitude, leading to a further drop in the transaction volume.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2009] Though the external environment is still fraught with uncertainties, mainland China, which has been less affected by the global financial tsunami, is expected to keep growing from strength to strength despite fine tuning of its moderately loose monetary policy on concerns of overheating in the property sector and inflation risk.

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010] The austerity policies for the mainland property market will remain intact in 2011.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2010] Property prices depend mainly on the supply and demand of a particular point in time, in much the same way as the price for a commodity is fixed.  In the case of properties, additional considerations, such as the location of the property, the quality of the design, material and finish, and facilities provided, would have a great impact on their pricing.  Other factors that have a bearing are the low interest rate environment and inflation expectations which would prompt investors to acquire properties for investment or as a hedge against inflation.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2011] For the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group sold 325 residential units in Hong Kong, generating attributable sales revenue of HK$8,308 million, a marked increase when compared with HK$4,842 million for the previous financial year.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 2011] The earnings from Hong Kong and China Gas and rental property portfolio serve as a solid base for the Group’s sustainable growth.
<BR><a href="lee-shau-kee-quotes.html">Lee Shau Kee<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The success of the Overseas Chinese is the result of bad times in China itself.  The Chinese who left the mother country had to struggle, and that became a culture of its own, passed on from father to son through each generation.  Because we have no social security, the Overseas Chinese habit is to save a lot and make a lot of friends.

<BR>
<BR>
[In 1994 on his father sending him to Texas in the US to prove himself.  He purchased and renovated a couple of thousand units on properties investing more than $230 million with annual rental returns of 13-14 percent.] Maybe it's good training, but the pressure is terrible.  After all those purchases my dad went there, checking out whether I made any mistakes. He was satisfied, and I got a free hand to develop property in China.

<BR>
[In 2001] Being a pioneer is always a very tough job.  Doing business in China is much more difficult compared to Hong Kong.
