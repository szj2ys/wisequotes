More than that, it was humanising.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I guess I was always too busy throwing away my crutches and taking out my own stitches.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I am going to beat this thing, whatever it is.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>The cancer was not just spreading, it was galloping, and Youman no longer thought I could afford to wait a week for chemo.  I should begin treatment directly, because if the cancer was moving that quickly, every day might count.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was depressed and falling apart emotionally from the shock of the diagnosis, and now I was supposed to summon an erection?  There was no way.  This isn’t the way it was supposed to happen.  I had no choice; I closed my eyes and did what I had to do.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I’m determined to fight this disease, and I will win.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Cycling is so hard, the suffering is so intense, that it’s absolutely cleansing.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>You can go out there with the weight of the world on your shoulders, and after a six-hour ride at a high pain threshold, you feel at peace.  The pain is so deep and strong that a curtain descends over your brain.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>At least for a while you have a kind of hall pass, and don’t have to brood on your problems; you can shut everything else out, because the effort and subsequent fatigue are absolute.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>There is an unthinking simplicity in something so hard, which is why there’s probably some truth to the idea that all world-class athletes are actually running away from something.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>The physical pain of cancer didn’t bother me so much, because I was used to it.  In fact, if I didn’t suffer, I’d feel cheated.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>The more I thought about it, the more cancer began to seem like a race to me.  Only the destination had changed.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Winning back my life would be the biggest victory.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>As long as I could move, I was healthy.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I had cancer, and I had no health insurance.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I had gone from making $2 million a year, to nothing.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>The porche that I so treasured now seemed like an item of pure decadent self-indulgence.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I think too that I was beginning to need to simplify things.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I became a student of cancer.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>I might as well go back to school and try to become a doctor, because I’m becoming so well-versed in this.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>The more research I did, the better I felt my chances were…<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I thought of medicine as something practiced by individual doctors on individual patients.  The doctor was all-knowing and all-powerful, and the patient was helpless.  But it was beginning to dawn on me that there was nothing wrong with seeking a cure from a combination of people and sources, and that the patient was as important as the doctor.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I had testicular cancer on Monday morning, stated chemo on Monday afternoon.  No it was Thursday, and it was in my brain.  This opponent was turning out to be much tougher than I’d thought.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>It’s in your lungs, it’s stage three, you have no insurance, now it’s in your brain.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>There was a certain relief in hearing the worst news yet… No doctor could tell me anything more; now I knew every terrible thing in the world.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Hope, that is the only antidote to fear.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>There is no proper way to estimate somebody’s chances, and we shouldn’t try, because we can never be entirely right, and it deprives people of hope.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Cancer was teaching me a tolerance for ambiguities.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I had always assumed that if I won bike races, it made me a stronger and more worthy person.  Not so.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>What is stronger, fear or hope?<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>To be afraid is a priceless education.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Once you have been that scared, you know more about your frailty than most people, and I think that changes a man.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>This disease would force me to ask more of myself as a person than I ever had before, and to seek out a different ethic.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>There was a disquieting intimacy to the idea that something was uninvited was living in my head.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>You picked the wrong guy.  When you looked around for a body to try to live in, you made a big mistake when you chose mine.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>If the deal is that I never cycle again, but I get to live, I’ll take it, I thought.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I’ll go back to school, I’ll be a trash man, do anything.  Just let me live.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I could accept the idea that I was perilously sick, but the idea of being reduced to feebleness was the most depressing thought of all.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I won’t walk, I won’t have children, I won’t ride, I thought.  Maybe this is too much.  Maybe this is more than I need.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-9.html">9<a/> </p><p><BR>
