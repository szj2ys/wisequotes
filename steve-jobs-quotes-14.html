No no.  This isn’t working at all.  I’m getting tired of asking about this.  Oh!  Right there!  That’s great!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I started the company with Steve Wozniak in my parents’ garage, and Steve is here today.  We were joined by Mike Markkula and soon after that our first president, Mike Scott.  Both of those folks are in the audience today.  And none of us would be here without these three guys.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>This is what computers look like today.  And I’d like to take the privilege of showing you what they are going to look like from today on.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It looks like it’s from another planet.  A good planet.  A planet with better designers.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Think Different.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The thing that our competitors are missing is that they think it’s about fashion, and they think it’s about surface appearance.  They say, we’ll slap a little color on this piece of junk computer, and we’ll have one, too.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We’re going to do all sorts of colors!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’d seen a slot-load drive on a very high-end Sony stereo.  So I went to the drive manufacturers and go them to do a slot-load drive for us for the version of the iMac we did nine months later.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I don’t care, that’s what I want.  I want you to do the slot-load drive for me as a personal favor.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Focus.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Just tell them if they f*ck with us, they’ll never get another f*cking dime from this company, ever.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>F*cking dickless assholes.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Tim Cook came out of procurement, which is just the right background for what we needed.  I realized that he and I saw things exactly the same way.  I had visited a lot of just-in-time factories in Japan, and I’d built one for the Mac and at NeXT.  I knew what I wanted, and I met Tim, and he wanted the same thing.  So we started to work together, and before long I trusted him to know exactly what to do.  He had the same vision I did, and we could interact at a high level, and I could just forget about a lot of things unless he came and pinged me.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On asking Akio Morita Sony’s chairman why everyone in his factories wore uniforms] He looked very ashamed and told me that after the war, no one had any clothes, and companies like Sony had to give their workers something to wear each day.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I decided that I wanted that [Sony type] of bonding for Apple.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>So I called Issey [Miyake] and asked him to design a vest for Apple.  I came back with some samples and told everyone it would be great if we would all wear these vests.  Oh man, did I get booed off the stage.  Everybody hated the idea.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>So I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I liked, and he made me like a hundred of them.  That’s what I wear.  I have enough to last for the rest of my life.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Our method was to develop integrated products, and that meant our process had to be integrated and collaborative.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On hiring] Then we all get together without the person and talk about whether they’ll fit in.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>For most things in life, the range between best and average is 30% or so.  The best airplane flight, the best meal, they may be 30% better than your average one.  What I saw with Woz was somebody who was fifty times better than the average engineer.  He could have meetings in his head.  The Mac team was an attempt to build a whole team like that, A players.  People said they wouldn’t get along, they’d hate working with each other.  But I realized that A players like to work with A players and they just didn’t like working with C players.  At Pixar, it was a whole company of A players.  When I got back to Apple, that’s what I decided to try to do.  You need to have a collaborative hiring process.  When we hire someone, even if they’re going to be in marketing, I will have them talk to the design folks and the engineers.  My role model was J. Robert Oppeneimer.  I read about he type of people he sought for the atom bomb project.  I wasn’t nearly as good as he was, but that’s what I aspired to do.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I said, ‘My God,’ and hired him on the spot.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>That’s a stupid idea.  Here’s what we’re going to do.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I make 50 cents for showing up, and the other 50 cents is based on performance.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I don’t want the people I work with at Apple to think I am coming back to get rich.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Let me be straight with you.  What I’d rather have is an airplane.  We just had a third kid.  I don’t like flying commercial.  I like to take my family to Hawaii.  When I go east, I’d like to have pilots I know.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I hadn’t been insisting on options before, but you suggested it could be up to 5% of the company in options, and that’s what I now want.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Oh, and one more thing.  So I am pleased to announce today that I’m going to drop the interim title.    You guys are making me feel funny now.  I get to come to work every day and work with the most talented people on the planet, at Apple and Pixar.  But these jobs are team sports.  I accept your thanks on behalf of everybody at Apple.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>All that the salesman cared about was a $50 spiff.  Unless we could find ways to get our message to customers at the store, we were screwed.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We may not be able to get them to drive ten miles to check out our products, but we can get them to walk then feet.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>If they’re passing by, they will drop in out of curiosity, if we make it inviting enough, and once we get a chance to show them what we have, we will win.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Is Apple as big of a brand as the Gap?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>The store will become the most powerful physical expression of the brand.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I just loved to wander over there on my own, just checking it out.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Do you know what a big change this is?  I’ve worked my ass off on this store for six months, and now you want to change everything!  I’m tired.  I don’t know if I can design another store from scratch.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Ron [Johnson] thinks we’ve got it all wrong.  He thinks it should be organized not around products but instead around what people do.  And you know, he’s right.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>If something isn’t right, you can’t just ignore it and say you’ll fix it later.  That’s what other companies do.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>You can’t call them geniuses.  They’re geeks.  They don’t have the people skills to deliver on something called the genius bar.  [But he said to trademark the name ‘genius bar’.]<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>This store grosses more per square foot than any store in the world.  It also grosses more in total – absolute dollars, not just per square foot – than any store in New York.  That includes Saks and Bloomingdale’s.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>This was state of the art in glass technology at the time.  We had to build our own autoclaves to make the glass.  If we wanted to do it with our current technology, we would have to make the cube a foot shorter.  And I didn’t want to do that.  So we have to build some new autoclaves in China.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-16.html">16<a/> </p><p><BR>
