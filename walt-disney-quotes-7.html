Some people think that we have class distinctions in this place.  They wonder why some get better seats in the theater than others.  They wonder why some men gets spaces in the parking lot and others can’t.  I have always felt, and always will feel, that the men who are contributing the most to the organization should, out of respect alone, enjoy some privileges…
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Definitely there is no ‘closed circle.’  Those men who have worked closely with me in trying to organize and keep this studio rolling, and keep its chin above water, should not be envied.  Frankly those fellows catch plenty of hell, and a lot of you can feel lucky you don’t have too much contact with me.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Here is a question that is asked many times, and about which I think a complete misunderstanding exists… The question is ‘Why can’t Walt see more of the fellows?  Why can’t there be less supervisors and more Walt?
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On it being very dangerous and unfair for him to get too close to any of his employees] This was especially true of new men.  You all know that there are always those who try to polish the apple… This is definitely unfair to the conscientious, hard-working individual who is not good at apple-polishing.  I… am well aware of the progress of all the men after they reach a certain spot in this organization.  Some of them I might not recognize when I meet them, but I know them by name and reputation.  Believe me, when a fellow shows something, I hear about it; and not through my central source but by a general contact with all the key men in the organization.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The stumbling and fumbling around of green, inexperienced people has cost this studio millions of dollars… My first recommendation to a lot of you is this: put your own house in order; put your own mind in order… You can’t accomplish a damn thing by sitting around and waiting to be told everything… Too many fellows are willing to blame their own stupidity on other people.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I lived in a little town in Missouri, and there were only two automobiles.  It was 1908.  They began to come in then.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father Elias’s peculiar way of talking] I could never figure some of the expressions he used.  He’d get mad at me and call me a little scud.  He says, ‘You little scud, I’ll take a gad to you.’ and I found out later, when I was digging into Irish lore and things, that a scud is equivalent to a little squirt… and a gad is something they used to sort of fail, you know, they used to beat the grain with it.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father Elias] He was the kindest fellow, and he thought of nothing but his family.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Dad was always meeting up with strange characters to talk socialism… He’d bring them home! … And anybody who could play an instrument… They were tramps, you know?  They weren’t even clean.  But he’d want to bring them into the dinner table, and my mother would have nothing of it.  She’d feed them out on the steps.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[When the family was scraping by on his mother putting extra butter on the kids bread and turning the slices over so that their father could not see it] We’d say to Dad, ‘Look there’s no butter on the bread.’  And it was just loaded underneath, you know?’
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his role on the farm] I just played.  I was sort of the pet in the family.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My father had a sickness, [Said to be diphtheria] and they decided to sell the farm.  So my dad… he had to auction all the stock and things.  And it was in the cold of the winter and I remember Roy and myself… going around to the different little towns and places, tacking up these posters of the auction.  And I remember my mother heating these bricks in the oven, we put the bricks in the floor of the buggy and a robe over us and we went around, all around tacking up these posters.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I was nine, my brother Roy and I were already businessmen.  We had a newspaper route… delivering papers in a residence area every morning and evening of the year, rain, shine, or snow.  We got up at 4:30am, worked until the school bell rang and did the same thing again from four o’clock in the afternoon until supper time.  Often I dozed at my desk, and my report card told the story.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I remember those icy cold days of crawling up these icy steps [to put the newspaper inside a storm door.]  I was so darn cold I’d slip, and I could cry, so I cried.  
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father paying other boys three or four dollars a week to help on the paper route but not Walt] He said it was part of my job.  I was part of the family.  He said, ‘I clothe and feed you.’… So he wouldn’t pay me.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The upshot of it was, I was working all the time.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the candy bars he was selling as a child] Couldn’t resist eating my own stock.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Fancy being remembered around the world for the invention of a mouse!
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I feel so sorry for people who lives in cities all their lives and… don’t have a little home town.  
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m glad my dad picked out a little town where he could have a farm, because those years that we spent here have been memorable years.

<BR>
[To an employee residing on a tiny farm outside Los Angeles in the late 1930s] Boy, I envy you.  Yeah, boy, some today I’d like to live on a ranch and have animals myself.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I was a kid, we lived on a farm and we had all kinds of animals.  I’d like to have that again.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I know in the early cartoons I used to feature a little outhouse and I known darn well I got that here in Marceline… We got a lot of laughs with that outhouse.  But, of course, as e got a little money to work with, why we got a little more refined about it.  The outhouse had to go.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the 1949 movie ‘So Dear to My Heart’] So Dear was especially close to me.  Why that’s the life my brother and I grew up with as kids out in Missouri.  The great racehorse Dan Patch [a figure in the film] was a hero to us.  We had Dan Patch’s grandson on my father’s farm.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On still dreaming about his childhood] That I have missed my customers on my [newspaper] route… And I wake up and think, gosh, I’ve got to hurry and get back… It’s the darnedest thing.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>

I never had any real play time.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[When he first got married in 1925 he told his wife that he couldn’t do lawn work and gardening because] I just did too much of it as a kid, and I just didn’t want to do it.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On pushing a cart helping his mother peddle country butter in various places to help meet expenses] But it was embarrassing at times, because I went to school with the kids that live there, you know?  There were kind of… wealthy children.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think I got a greater education by [serving in the ambulance corps in France] than you can ever Jam into anybody by going through this methodical business of going to school everyday.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[Military experience helped teach him to] Line right up on an objective.  And I went for it.  And I’ve never had any regrets.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My mother was the one with the humor…
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We could even conspire with my mother to get around my dad, you know?… Mother would just put him down in his place.  She’d say, ‘Now Elias, now Elias, you stop that!  Now Elias, you’re going too far!
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his memory of seeing on of his favorite teachers after he marched into school on winter mornings, frozen from delivering newspapers and seeing] You and Miss Shrewsbury standing over the radiators while the heat bellowed out your skirts.  It looked very comfortable to me on those cold mornings – and sometimes I wished that I might have worn skirts myself!
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being given an address of a place to stay in Colorado during a stopover which turned out to be a bordello] Well, I was pretty naïve, but I soon caught onto where in the hell I was, you see?  Then I got out of there as fast as I could drink the beer.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On returning from France to see a girl from high school that he had talked to all through his France service but discovering that she had been married for three months] I was through with women.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his mother having to go into his father’s little coin pursue every so often and take the quarter out and putting a new one in] I’m not kidding you, it was turning green.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My father never drank whisky or smoked or used any swear words… and [he was] very slow to catch onto a gag or a joke.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On believing his father was deceived in his various business ventures because] He thought everyone was as honest as he was.
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father] He believed that ‘Putting fertilizer on plants was just the same as giving whiskey to a man – he felt better for a little while, but then he was worse off than he was before.’
<BR><a href="walt-disney-quotes.html">Walt Disney<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On him looking at his father’s socialist publications] I got so I could draw capital and labor pretty good – the big fat capitalist with the money, maybe with his foot on the neck of the laboring man with the little cap on his head.
