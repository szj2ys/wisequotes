I proud of our business and I think it’s a good thing.  I think Melbourne’s better because Crown is here.

Life and happiness and addiction and all of those things are all very complicated issues.

Hopefully I don’t gamble more than I should.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
On the tables I’m not as big a gambler as he [Kerry Packer] was.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A couple of billion dollars, so that’s a gamble.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>

<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>

We tried to be very factual, very logical and the response that comes back is [that] you’re Mugabe.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We look forward to working with governments and other stakeholders to build on Australia’s strengths as an attractive tourism destination.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
For some years now we have shown our confidence in Australia, leading the way in investment in tourism infrastructure.  Our current $2.3 billion capital expenditure program demonstrates our continued faith in the Australian economy, Australia’s appeal as a tourism destination for the Asian region and our ability to deliver integrated resorts of international quality.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Annually, over 24 million visitors enjoy the world-class facilities we have on offer in Melbourne and Perth.  Many of our visitors are from interstate and international destinations which makes Crown Melbourne and Burswood important tourism drivers for Australia.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think it may be even a bigger story than the internet. You know, it's like saying, ‘how big a deal is the internet?’ The Chinese middle-class is going to change the world.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
When the global financial crisis came along in 2008 it was scary times if you were in the middle of building $5 billion buildings. It wasn't perfect.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm not saying that casinos for Chinese tourism is the only answer for Tourism Australia. But equally, I think that a lot of the Chinese tourists like man-made attractions as well as natural attractions.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Tourism around the world, the successful tourism around the world, is about man-made attractions.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think there will always be abolitionists and I don't think that there are many examples where abolition has been terribly successful.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>

<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I genuinely believe if we get the chance to do something in Sydney, the people of Australia will win out of that proposal. There will be jobs, taxes, tourism – there’ll be more people coming to Australia looking to spend money and I think that is a good thing.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My dad was the smartest bloke in the room – he was the smartest bloke in the room. But he loved being in a casino – it was the most fun thing he did.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his father] If he was here, mate, it wouldn't be my casino, it would be his.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dad was tough with his intellect but not with his emotions.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Kerry was such a large character that all of our lives are less full and less interesting without him…
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think that my father has been amazingly generous to me.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My dad occasionally gave me a hard time but I must say that when I needed him to be supportive, when I needed him as a son or as a businessman, when I needed his support, he was always supportive.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think that if I try and be you know a mini version of Kerry that I’m going to fail because he was such a larger than life character, so I’m going to do my best being myself…
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>

I don’t think I’ll strike fear into the hearts of Vegas casinos or bookmakers the way he did…
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I think he was unique.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
He was larger than life in all those areas because he could be literally so charming, so charming, I mean world world world class and he could be terrifying and both of those approaches could make the person sitting on the other side of the desk a little less sure of themselves.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My dad has been quoted publicly as saying he’s not sure he believes there is life after this life and it was eerie after he died to be there with him and to be there with a body, that was so different to his character, which was so alive, made me think that there must be something. I’m taking the positive and hoping and wishing that he’s up there looking down on us.
<BR><a href="james-packer-quotes.html">James Packer<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
How many forty-four year olds wouldn’t have liked to have had my life?
