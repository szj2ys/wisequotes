<BR>
My grief was like a mountain that hid all of heaven from me.
<BR><B>Macrina Wiederkehr</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
When a person is born we rejoice, and when they're married we jubilate, but when they die we try to pretend nothing has happened.
<BR><B>Margaret Mead</B>  
<BR>
<BR>
No one ever really dies as long as they took the time to leave us with fond memories.  
<BR><B>Chris Sorensen</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Every one can master a grief but he that has it.
<BR><B>William Shakespeare</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
What is called happiness is an abstract idea, composed of various ideas of pleasure; for he who has but a moment of pleasure is not a happy man, in like manner that a moment of grief constitutes not a miserable one.
<BR><B>Voltaire</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
You will lose someone you can’t live without, and your heart will be badly broken, and the bad news is that you never completely get over the loss of your beloved. But this is also the good news. They live forever in your broken heart that doesn’t seal back up. And you come through. It’s like having a broken leg that never heals perfectly - that still hurts when the weather gets cold, but you learn to dance with the limp.
<BR><B>Anne Lamott</B>
<BR>
<BR>
What we have once enjoyed deeply we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us. 
<BR><B>Helen Keller</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Grief and guilt. A powerful combination. Guilt like a liquid, a thin liquor, seeping everywhere, informing everything, saturating the whole--corrosive, like seawater, scented with the rich stench of ordure and corruption, and carrying with it hard, abrasive shards of grief.
<BR><B>Simon Mawer</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Grief knits two hearts in closer bonds than happiness ever can; and common sufferings are far stronger links than common joys. 
<BR><B>Alphonse de Lamartine</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Courage is being afraid but going on anyhow.  
<BR><B>Dan Rather</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grief is itself a medicine.
<BR><B>William Cowper</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
The reality is that we don't forget, move on, and have closure, but rather we honor, we remember, and incorporate our deceased children and siblings into our lives in a new way. In fact, keeping memories of your loved one alive in your mind and heart is an important part of your healing journey.
<BR><B>Harriet Schiff</B>
<BR>
<BR>
We postpone the finality of heartbreak by clinging to hope. Though this might be acceptable during early or transitional stages of grief, ultimately it is no way to live. We need both hands free to embrace life and accept love, and that's impossible if one hand has a death grip on the past.
<BR><B>Kristin Armstrong</B>
<BR>
<BR> 
I will not say, do not weep, for not all tears are an evil.
<BR><B>J R R Tolkien</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Happiness is beneficial for the body, but it is grief that develops the powers of the mind. 
<BR><B>Marcel Proust</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
You can clutch the past so tightly to your chest that it leaves your arms too full to embrace the present.  
<BR><B>Jan Glidewell</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Parting is all we know of heaven and all we need of hell.
<BR><B>Emily Dickinson</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Without you in my arms, I feel an emptiness in my soul. I find myself searching the crowds for your face - I know it's an impossibility, but I cannot help myself. 
<BR><B>Nicholas Sparks</B>
<BR>
<BR>
If you suppress grief too much, it can well redouble. 
<BR><B>Moliere</B> 
<BR>
<BR> 
In the night of death, hope sees a star, and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.  
<BR><B>Robert Ingersoll</B>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
To spare oneself from grief at all cost can be achieved only at the price of total detachment, which excludes the ability to experience happiness.
<BR><B>Erich Fromm</B>
<BR>
<BR>
If I can see pain in your eyes then share with me your tears. If I can see joy in your eyes then share with me your smile.
<BR><B>Santosh Kalwar</B>
<BR>
<BR>
In times of grief and sorrow I will hold you and rock you and take your grief and make it my own. When you cry I cry and when you hurt I hurt. And together we will try to hold back the floods to tears and despair and make it through the potholed street of life.
<BR><B>Nicholas Sparks</B>
<BR>
<BR>
If you would have me weep, you must first of all feel grief yourself. 
<BR><B>Horace</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
Even if happiness forgets you a little bit, never completely forget about it.  
<BR><B>Jacques Prévert</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Memory is a way of holding on to the things you love, the things you are, the things you never want to lose.
<BR><B>The Wonder Years</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Every evening I turn my worries over to God.  He's going to be up all night anyway.  
<BR><B>Mary C Crowley</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Teams share the burden and divide the grief. 
<BR><B>Doug Smith</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Lucky that man whose children make his happiness in life and not his grief, the anguished disappointment of his hopes. 
<BR><B>Euripedes</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I often think of my isolation with grief. I cannot complain of anything else, for our health is not bad, the child is growing well, and I have the best husband one could dream of; I could never have imagined finding one like him. He is a true gift of heaven, and the more we live together the more we love each other.
<BR><a href="marie-curie-quotes.html">Marie Curie<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
<BR>
<BR>
In my financial dealings, the discover of error would often present an opportunity to take whatever profits I had made from my flawed initial insight or cut my losses if the insight had not yielded even a temporary profitable result. Most people are reluctant to admit that they are wrong; it game me positive pleasure to discover a mistake because I know it could save me from financial grief.
