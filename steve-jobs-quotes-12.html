I think all this is crazy.  You and I have a good relationship.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>You and I need to go out and have a great bottle of wine to celebrate!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On selling 1.5 million Apple shares] I didn’t feel I needed to tell Gil.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On being asked to again become Apple CEO] I will help.  I will be an advisor.  Unpaid.  That’s all I can give now.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I got a call from Apple’s board of directors three weeks ago asking me to return to Apple as their CEO.  I declined.  They then asked me to become chairman, and I again declined.  So don’t worry – the crazy rumors are just that.  I have no plans to leave Pixar.  You’re stuck with me.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We’d just taken Pixar public, and I was happy being CEO there.  I never knew of anyone who served as CEO of two public companies, even temporarily, and I wasn’t even sure it was legal.  I didn’t know what I wanted to do.  I was enjoying spending more time with my family.  I was torn.  I knew Apple was a mess, so I wondered: Do I want to give up this nice lifestyle that I have?  What are all the Pixar shareholders going to think?  I talked to people I respected.  I finally called Andy Grove at about eight one Saturday morning – too early.  I gave him the pros and the cons, and in the middle he stopped me and said, ‘Steve, I don’t give a sh*t about Apple.’ I was stunned.  It was then I realized that I do give a sh*t about Apple – I started it and it is a good thing to have in the world.  That was when I decided to go back on a temporary basis to help them hire a CEO.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Gee, Gil, I just wanted you to know, I talked to Ed today about this thing and I really feel bad about it.  I want you to know that I had absolutely nothing to do with this turn of events, it was a decision the board made, but they had asked for advice and counsel.  Take six months off.  When I got thrown out of Apple, I immediately went back to work, and I regretted it.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Okay, tell me what’s wrong with this place.  It’s the products!  So what’s wrong with the products?  The products suck!  There’s no sex in them anymore!<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>It has to be done fast.  We’re losing good people.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>You brought me here to fix this thing, and people are the key.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Are you nuts?!?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Guys, if you don’t want to do this, I’m not coming back on Monday.  Because I’ve got thousands of key decisions to make that are far more difficult than this, and if you can’t throw your support behind this kind of decision, I will fail.  So if you can’t do this, I’m out of here, and you can blame it one me, you can say, ‘Steve wasn’t up for the job.’<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Stop the train, this isn’t going to work.  This company is in shambles, and I don’t have time to wet-nurse the board.  So I need all of you to resign [Except for Woolard].  Or else I’m going to resign and not come back on Monday. <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>They were an awful board, a terrible board.  I agreed they could keep Ed Woolard and a guy named Gareth Chang, who turned out to be a zero.  He wasn’t terrible, just a zero.  Woolard , on the other hand, was on eof the best board members I’ve ever seen.  He was a prince, one of the most supportive and wise people I’ve ever met.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Mike Markkula] I felt deeply betrayed by him, but he was like a father and I always cared about him.   <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Arthur [Levitt], I don’t think you’d be happy on our board, and I think it best if we not invite you.  Frankly, I think some of the issues you raised, while appropriate for some companies, really don’t apply to Apple’s culture.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I’m Steve Jobs, the chairman and CEO of Pixar.  I, like a lot of other people, are pulling together to help Apple get healthy again.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>There’s a lot of great people at Apple, but they’re doing the wrong things because the plan has been wrong.  I’ve found people who can’t wait to fall into line behind a good strategy, but there just hasn’t been one.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I think you still have to think differently to buy an Apple computer.  The people who buy them do think different.  They are the creative spirits in this world, and they’re out to change the world.  We make tools for those kinds of people.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We too are going to think differently and serve the people who have been buying our products from the beginning.  Because a lot of people think they’re crazy, but in that craziness we see genius.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Apple lives in an ecosystem.  It needs help from other partners.  Relationships that are destructive don’t help anybody in this industry.  I’d like to announce one of our first new partnerships today, a very meaningful one, and that is one with Microsoft.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>I called Bill [Gates] and said, ‘I’m going to turn this thing around.’  Bill always had a soft spot for Apple.  We got him into the application software business.  The first Microsoft apps were Excel and Word for the Mac.  So I called him and said, ‘I need your help.’  Microsoft was walking over Apple’s patents.  I said, ‘If we kept up our lawsuits, a few years from now we could win a billion-dollar patent suit.  You know it, and I know it.  But Apple’s not going to survive that long if we’re at war.  I know that.  So let’s figure out how to settle this right away.  All I need is a commitment that Microsoft will keep developing for the Mac and an investment by Microsoft in Apple so it has a stake in our success.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On Bill Gates deal] Hey, that deal is too complicated.  What I want is a simple deal.  I want the commitment and I want an investment.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[To Microsoft] These are the things we care about.  A commitment to make software for the Mac and an investment.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Hi, Bill.  Bill, thankyou for your support of this company.  I think the world’s a better place for it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Apple has decided to make Internet Explorer its default browser on the Macintosh.  Since we believe in choice, we’re going to be shipping other Internet browsers, as well, and the user can, of course change their default should they choose to.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I happen to have a special guest with me today via satellite downlink.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I wanted him to come to Boston.  That was my worst and stupidest staging event ever.  It was bad because it made me look small, and Apple look small, and as if everything was in Bill’s hands.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win Microsoft has to lose… I think if we want Microsoft Office on the Mac, we better treat the company that puts it out with a little bit of gratitude.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>Hi Lee [Clow], this is Steve.  Guess what?  Amelio just resigned.  Can you come up here?<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We have to prove that Apple is still alive, and that it still stands for something special.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>This chokes me up, this really chokes me up.  It was clear that Lee loved Apple so much.  Here was the best guy in advertising.  And he hadn’t pitched in ten years.  Yet here he was, and he was pitching his heart out, because he loved Apple as much as we did.  He and his team had come up with this brilliant idea, ‘Think Different.’  And it was ten times better than anything the other agencies showed.  It choked me up, and it still makes me cry to think about it, both the fact that Lee card so much and also how brilliant his ‘Think Different’ idea was.  Every once in a while, I find myself in the presence of purity – purity of spirit and love – and I always cry.  It always just reaches in and grabs me.  That was one of those moments.  There was a purity about that I will never forget.  I cried in my office as he was showing me the idea, and I still cry when I think about it.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>This wasn’t about processor speed or memory.  It was about creativity.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>We at Apple had forgotten who we were.  One way to remember who you are is to remember who your heroes are.  That was the genesis of that campaign.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>This is sh*t!  It’s advertising agency sh*t and I hate it.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>They push the human race forward.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>There’s a germ of a brilliant idea there. <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>This is not the right picture of Gandhi.  <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>I like living at the intersection of the humanities and technology.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>[On his daughter Eve] She’s a pistol and has the strongest will of any kid I’ve ever met.  It’s like payback.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR>For young people, this whole world is the same now.<BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">Steve Jobs<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="steve-jobs-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="steve-jobs-quotes-16.html">16<a/> </p><p><BR>
