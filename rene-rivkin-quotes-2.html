<p>102 Rene Rivkin Quotes</p><p><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="rene-rivkin-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="rene-rivkin-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="4347677141";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>If you bid your top price straightaway, you’ve got no room for manoeuvring, there’s no game on, there’s no bargaining position.  But if you bid a price lower than you’re prepared to pay, and I would say that probably nine out of every ten bids are in that category, then you’ve got some room to work with.  The bidder generally offers less than they’re prepared to pay.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>If you can buy a stock with a serious bidder at below the bid price, you buy it.  If you can buy it at the bid price, you still buy it.  If you can buy it a fraction above the bid price, you still buy it.  It works nine times out of ten.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>I am an event-driven, value-based investor.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>I’m not interested in gambling on stocks that clearly have no value.  Now E-toys clearly had no value and has since dropped about 95%.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>You can’t pay dividends out of losses.  No-one has invented that yet.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>I specialise in short and medium-term investments … I think there’s nothing quite so much fun, nothing quite so orgasmic, as waking up in the morning and making 50% on your money in a takeover bid that’s just happened.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>All investments are a risk proposition.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>The pain of losing money is greater than the pleasure of making it.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Always calculate a risk/reward ratio for every investment.  This will help you decide whether to risk your capital or not and, if so help you decide how much capital to risk.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Ask yourself, ‘Am I happy with the result?’  If not, then you should be committed to a mental asylum.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Capital allocation is a critical part of successful investing.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>A good company can be overpriced and a bad company can be underpriced.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>This is the hardest rule of [stock market] life, but I believe I’ve solved it.  You sell a stock when you’re happy … if you bought a stock at 30c and you’re happy that it has gone up to 45c, then sell it by all means.  You’ve made a profit and you’re happy.  Forget that it might go to 60c or 70c.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Almost all my losses have been because I strayed from my investment rules.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>I am a very strong believer in luck and there are some people who are damned unlucky.  If you can latch onto one of those damned unlucky people and do the opposite of what he does, you are bound to be damned lucky, aren’t you?  It’s obvious.  I’ll bet you everyone in this audience, who entered the stock market, has met a person who has said to them ‘you won’t believe it, every time I touch the stock market, it goes against me!’.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>If Solly Lew [Solomon Lew] is selling his Coles Myer, I’m not a buyer.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>No person has ever been successful without the help of somebody else.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Associate with successful people because some of it is bound to rub off.  I always have.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>There’s insider trading going on everywhere in the world, all day, all night, everywhere, and everyone wants it.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Make sure … that you’re not buying absolute garbage.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>During the dot.com boom, every restaurant I went to, I got tips from waiters, taxi drivers and so on.  There were some French waiters who had barely been in Australia for 3 months who started tipping me stocks.  I think it’s remarkable people take tips from people who aren’t connected to the business.  There was this very famous rich man in the 1920s called Bernard Baruch, and he said that ‘when the janitors start buying, you sell’.  Regard every tip you ever get with suspicion, unless it comes from someone you know very, very well and you know there’s a logic to their being connected to the situation.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>People wait for stock markets … stock markets do not wait for people.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>To make money in the stock market, I believe you have to be entirely passionate (except for long-term investing, which can take care of itself).  Be passionate … live it, breathe it, talk it.  You will learn all the time.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>I don’t know where the market’s going, but I believe that I don’t have to know where the market’s going.  I believe I have to stick to the rules that I formulated over 30 odd years, and with these rules and with my devotion to the market, I can keep picking winners …<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>When taxi drivers give you tips, it is time to believe the bull market is nearing it’s end.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Never risk your lifestyle on any one investment.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Save your capital for the great ideas.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Make sure you understand every investment you make.  Therefore, don’t invest in anything that you do not understand.  Warren Buffett agrees with me.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Follow the trend.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>When in doubt, get out.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>When a market makes a new high for the first time in a while, it will most likely continue the trend.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>If you don’t know why you are holding an investment, then sell it.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>If you don’t have a number of good reasons for holding an investment, then you should not hold it… the fact that you bought it above the current price is not a good reason.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Never underestimate the importance of patience or luck.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Use market volatility, don’t fear it.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>There are times when preserving capital is the prime objective.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Most trading problems come from breaking one rule … cut your losses short and run your profits.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Never spend your profits before you have liquidated the position.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Invest in the fundamentals, but trade the price action.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR>Index funds are another way of saying that you don’t know what you are doing.<BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">Rene Rivkin<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="rene-rivkin-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="rene-rivkin-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="rene-rivkin-quotes-3.html">3<a/> </p><p><BR>
