Mature men wouldn’t have put us through such an experience…<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> [On cutting her hair]  No, I’m keeping it pinned up when I’m home.  I only cut off a little every few weeks.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> [On an Airster plane] It was not a plane for a beginner.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I am not marrying anybody.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I plan to work very hard this year and [do] little else but fly.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> We didn’t expect to make money for a long time, we knew we’d make mistakes and have to find correctives.  But what we build we intend to build solid and I think we have…<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I remember the sting of snow on my face as it was blown back from the propellers when the training plane took off on ski’s.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I’ll see what I can do to keep Mother and Dad together, Pidge, but after that I’m going to come back here and live my own life.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Perhaps this… doesn’t seem very convincing, for obviously my salary as a playmate of office boys would have to run on a long time before it would wipe out the balance of $2,000.  But it did help my credit immensely!  I think it made my flying companions believe I was in earnest.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>Not much more than a month ago I was on the other shore of the Pacific, looking westward.  This evening, I look eastward over the Pacific.  In those fast-moving days which have intervened, the whole width of the world had passed behind us – except this broad ocean.  I shall be glad when we have the hazards of its navigation behind us.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Oh, for a country-wide campaign of sign painting!<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Coming down thought a hole in the clouds, any flyer is thankful for a definite check as to his location, even if it is only to check his navigation… imagine automobiling without signs!  Imagine trying to recognize a new town the way flyers do – a hundred-mile-an-hour look at a checkerboard of streets and roofs, trees and fields, with highways and railroads radiating and crisscrossing and perhaps a river or two to complicate – or simplify – the geography lesson.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I’m a flier pursing my passion for the fun of it.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I’m going to fly around the world.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I want to be free.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I understand the danger, I can handle it.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I will!<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I’ll make it, I know I will.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> In my life I had come to realize that when things were going very well indeed it was just the time to anticipate trouble. And, conversely, I learned from pleasant experience that at the most despairing crisis, when all looked sour beyond words, some delightful ‘break’ was apt to lurk just around the corner.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>To all my friends, both near and far, let me say that you will hear from me in less than fifteen hours.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> One of my favorite phobias is that girls especially those whose tastes aren’t routine, often don’t get a fair break.  It has come down through the generations an inheritance of age-old customs which produced the corollary that women are bred to timidity.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> The lure of flying is the lure of beauty.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Please know I am aware of the hazards.  I want to do it because I want to do it.  Women must try to do things as men have tried.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Spring hints its coming first for birds and aviators.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> The actual doing of a dangerous thing may require little courage.  The preparation of it – the acceptance of the inevitable risks involved – may be a far greater test of morale.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I prefer good mechanical work to rabbits’ feet.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Courage is the price that life exacts for granting peace.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> When I undertake a task over all protest and in spite of all adversity, I sometimes thrill with the realization that I am doing something I want to do.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I could scarcely wait to be on my way.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>[From her mother] Shakespeare has no heroes: he has only heroines.  <BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> [On planning to see an operation] [I] plan on getting everything I can, if I can wheadle anybody into letting me.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I’m not in love with anybody – yet.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Are you sure you’re ready to give up your career?<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Take to the air!<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Decide whether or not the goal is worth the risks involved. If it is, stop worrying....<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> I lay no claim to advancing scientific data other than advancing flying knowledge. I can only say that I do it because I want to.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Worry retards reaction and makes clear-cut decisions impossible.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> [My] value as a social worker is nil while this hullabaloo keeps up.<BR><a href="amelia-earhart-quotes.html">Amelia Earhart<a/><BR><BR> Gentlemen, there is an aroma of cowardice in this air.  Whether you live in fear or defend your integrity is your decision.  I have made mine.
