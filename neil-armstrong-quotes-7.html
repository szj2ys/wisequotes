Space flight would have been an unrealistic ambition.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> I don’t remember reading about the Wrights [Bros] or anything about any of the books I read in the first grade.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> How long must it take before I cease to be known as a spaceman?<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> I enjoyed the training immensely, but they had a way of adding a degree of intensity to it.  There was always a lot of pressure to do things with perfection.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> One person might advance along his track faster than someone else in the same class.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> If the LSO deems you cannot complete a successful landing or a safe landing, he will wave his paddles at you – a so called wave off and you’re immediately commanded to add full power and ‘go around’ and try again.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> [Flying in navy] I didn’t want to be responsible for anybody else.  I’d better just watch my self.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>I happened to be a day fighter pilot.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small. <BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> [On a capsule being temporarily out of control] Anyway, it wasn’t any worse than some of the scares I received driving an automobile.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> [In response to a reporter saying ‘Mr Armstrong, I know an astronaut who would go to the moon even if he knew he wouldn’t come back’] I rule him out.  If you knew him, he’d be a boy, not an adult.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> [On ‘Do you mean you don’t have a taste for adventure’]  For heaven’s sake, I loathe danger, especially if it’s useless; danger is the most irritating aspect of our job.  How can a perfectly normal technological fact be turned into adventure?  And why should steering a spacecraft be risking your life?  It would be as illogical as risking your life when you use an electric mixer to make yourself a milkshake.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> Just hanging on and punching buttons.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> I’d like to take this opportunity to thank all my gracious hosts here in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory.  I can’t say that I would choose to spend a couple of weeks like that, but I’m glad we got the chance to complete the mission.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> [On all the reporters chasing him] This is certainly the part we’re least prepared to handle.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> I try to fulfil my obligations but I simply don’t comment on subjects where I’m not competent.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> People are a third-rank category of things to talk about.  Someone once said, ‘Great men talk about ideas; good men talk about things; and everyone else talks about other people.’<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>My Vacation – Nine summers ago, I went for a visit, to see if the moon was green cheese.  When we arrived, people on Earth asked: ‘Is it.’  We answered: ‘No cheese, no bees, no trees.’<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> I was a test pilot, not an adventurer.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> [On being asked if the moon visit had changed his life.] I don’t think I’m any different.  I’m hemming and hawing in front of the cameras just life I did twenty years ago.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> I was elated, ecstatic and extremely surprised that we were successful. <BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> In much of society, research means to investigate something you do not know or understand. <BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> It's a brilliant surface in that sunlight. The horizon seems quite close to you because the curvature is so much more pronounced than here on earth. It's an interesting place to be. I recommend it. <BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> As for walking on the moon, sometimes I wonder if that really happened.  I can honestly say – and it’s a great surprise to me – that I have never had a dream about being on the moon.  It’s a great disappointment to me.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> I believe that spaceflight was certainly one of, and perhaps the, greatest engineering achievement, but it was selected number twelve [His list of the inventions that best helped humans.] on the basis of its effect on the quality of life, and I do not disagree.  While the impact of seeing our planet from afar has an overpowering effect on people around the earth, and provided technology for tens of thousands of new products, other nominees were judged to have a greater impact on worldwide living standards.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> If anything shines as an example of how engineering has changed the world… it is clearly the power we use in our homes and businesses.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> Okay world, hold onto your hat.  I’m going to turn you upside down.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> <BR><BR>Mystery creates wonder and wonder is the basis of man's desire to understand. <BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> Research is creating new knowledge.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> I fully expected that, by the end of the century, we would have achieved substantially more than we actually did. <BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> I guess we all like to be recognized not for one piece of fireworks, but for the ledger of our daily work. <BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> [On promoting recycling] You know, the purpose of all those Moon walks was to take the garbage out.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> Gliders, sail planes, they're wonderful flying machines. It's the closest you can come to being a bird. <BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind. <BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> Yeah, I wasn't chosen to be first. I was just chosen to command that flight. Circumstance put me in that particular role. That wasn't planned by anyone. <BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> America means opportunity.  It started that way.  The early settlers came to the new world for the opportunity to worship in keeping with their conscience, and to build a future on the strength of their own initiative and hard work… They discovered a new life with freedom to achieve their individual goals.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> I love to teach. I love the kids, only they were smarter than I was, which made it a challenge.<BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="neil-armstrong-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="neil-armstrong-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="neil-armstrong-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="neil-armstrong-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="neil-armstrong-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="neil-armstrong-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="neil-armstrong-quotes-8.html">8<a/>      </p><p><BR>
