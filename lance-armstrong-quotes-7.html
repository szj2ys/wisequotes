It made me feel clean.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I saw an eerie sight: the road still had my name painted on it.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I saw my life as a whole.  I saw the pattern and the privilege of it, and the purpose of it, too.  It was simply this: I was meant for a long, hard climb.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was restored.  I was a bike racer again.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I didn’t just jump back on the bike and win.  There were a lot of ups and downs, good results and bad results, but this time I didn’t let the lows get to me.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Even when I was in bad shape, suffering, crashing, trying to come back, I never once, never, ever, ever, thought about abandoning again.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was not only back, I was better.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was capable of winning any race in the world.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I wanted to win the Tour de France.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>What you learn in survivorship is that after all the shouting is done, after the desperation and crisis is over, after you have accepted the fact of your illness and celebrated the return of your health, the old routines and habits, like shaving the morning with a purpose, a job to go to, and a wife to love and a child to raise these are the threads that tie your days together and that give them the pattern deserving of the term ‘a life’.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>I felt like I was at an Al-Anon meeting: ‘Hi, my name is Lance and I have no sperm.’<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>It was not quite the romantic candlelight interlude we had in mind, but we were now prepared to conceive a child.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I pushed her in a wheelchair out to our car, and for only the second time in my life, I drove the speed limit home.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I picture you on an eleven hour international flight with the triplets.  See also: insanity, fatigue, catatonic state, insomnia.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Life is long – hopefully.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>It’s a contest in purposeless suffering.  But for reasons of my own, I think it may be the most gallant athletic endeavour in the world.  To me, of course, it’s about living.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I suffered like the proverbial dog…  <BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>There was one unforeseen benefit of cancer: it had completely reshaped my body.  <BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Sometimes Kik’s friends would say ‘Oh you live in the South of France, how glamorous.’ They had no idea.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I rode, and I rode and I rode.  I rode like I had never ridden, punishing my body up and down every hill I could find.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>I rode when no one else would ride, sometimes not even my team-mates.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I rode for seven straight hours, alone.  To win the tour I had to be willing to ride when no one else would ride.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was the first American riding for an American team, on an American bike, ever to lead the Tour de France.  That morning, I looked at the date: it was July 4.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>The tour wasn’t exactly the ideal situation for a conjugal visit…<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I could feel the lactic acid seeping through my legs.  My face was one big grimace of pain.  I had gone out too hard – and now I was paying.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I fell off the bike, so tired I was cross-eyed.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I had never been a renowned climber, and now we were about to embark on the most gruelling and storied stages of the race, through peaks that made riders crack like walnuts.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I found myself out in front among the top climbers in the world, working alone.  I intended to make them suffer until they couldn’t breathe.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>We had been on the bikes for five and a half hours, and all of us were struggling.  From here on in it would be a question of who cracked and who didn’t.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>It was time to go.  It was strange, but I still didn’t feel a thing.  It was… effortless.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>When you open a gap, and your competitors don’t respond, it tells you something.  They’re hurting.  And when they’re hurting, that’s when you take them.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>To race and suffer, that’s hard.  But it’s not being laid out in a hospital bed with a catheter hanging out of your chest, platinum burning in your veins, throwing up for 24 hours straight, five days a week.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>You don’t really see the mountains as you ride through them.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>Maybe no one but a cancer patient understands the severity of the treatment.  For three straight months I was given some of the most toxic substances known to man, poisons that ravaged my body daily.  I still felt poisoned – and even now, three years after the fact, I feel that my body isn’t quite rid of it yet.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>We called the doctors [Drug testing doctors] the Vampires.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>It was so hot that in places the road tar melted under our wheels.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I had fallen back into my oldest bad habit, a senseless charge and waste of energy.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I began to notice something.  The people who whispered and wrote that I was using drugs where the very same ones who, when I was sick, had said, ‘He’s finished.  He’ll never race again.’  They were the same ones who, when I wanted to come back, said ‘No, we don’t want to give him a chance.  He’ll never amount to anything.’  It’s a good thing I didn’t listen to them when I was sick.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>I was beginning to feel the press was trying to break me mentally, because the other riders couldn’t do it physically.  The media had become as much of an obstacle as the terrain itself.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR>The smart play was to avoid any mistakes, don’t fall, don’t hurt yourself, and don’t lose ten minutes because of a crash.  I didn’t care.<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="lance-armstrong-quotes-9.html">9<a/> </p><p><BR>
