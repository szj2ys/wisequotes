Despite facing this big economic crisis.  I’ve found that at least two companies larger than ours to work with me on a long term investment project in Hong Kong.  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I often think back on the past few decades.  Almost every time Hong Kong was in a lull and people had lost confidence, I made investments, large investments; particularly from 1983 to 85, when public confidence was down and the economy was I bad shape.  I made heavy investment, totalling over 10 billion dollars.  The government, past or present has never given me one iota of privilege.  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Hong Kong people are realistic, diligent, flexible and innovative.  If we can, like in the 50’s, 60’s and 70’s, go about our business with the same fighting spirit, I have great faith in Hong Kong people.  After all, through thick and thin this is our home.

<BR>
My life differs from the lives of most people in that I didn’t have a childhood.  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
War broke out when I was ten, I was constantly on the move.  First to make a living and later for my career.  In this life of mine, I think if I make up for what I lost in my youth… like education and medical health if I can make some contribution in such areas as long as I’m up to it… I would like to do more.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The hills have remained the same, as has the environment.  One hundred… one thousand years from now, they will remain the same but the people now will not be there…

I made a lot of money in 1957 and 1958 and was very happy.  But does having money mean real happiness?  I was beginning to wonder and felt the answer was ‘not necessarily’.  Later I had the conundrum thought out.  I should make more money and use it when opportunity arises.  Only making money like this has any meaning.

Some morning I was trying to get my car key from my pocket and accidentally dropped a two dollar coin.  It rolled underneath the car, if the car was moved, the coin would fall into the drain.  So I squatted down to try to get the coin back, not wanting to lose it.  The guard saw me doing that came up to ask me, ‘Mr Li, what’s up?’.  I said I’d dropped a coin.  He then gave me some help.  The coin was picked up, I got two dollars back and gave him one hundred dollars.  Why did I do that?  If I hadn’t picked up the coin, when the car moved the coin would drop into the drain and would be lost forever.  But I got it back and gave the guard one hundred dollars, which would not be lost because he would make use of it.  In a word, money may be spent but never squandered.

Before, I used 99% of our time together to teach them [His children] principles of life.  Now we talk about business sometimes… one third of the time for business, and the other two thirds still for principles of life.  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>

<BR>
Had I wanted to live in luxury, I could definitely have done so in 1960.  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>

[When his children were very small] I took them to squatters’ areas and took them on tram and bus rides although I already had a chauffeur and a car.

<BR>
The character ‘Tzar’ was chosen in accordance with our family decree.

<BR>
There’s an interesting story about Richard [Li].  When he was a boy, a friend of mine gave him a big toy.  Very big it was, big and very expensive a toy tank that boys love.  Some Sunday morning we were going out to sea and Richard was very carefully wrapping up the toy with paper.  I thought it strange because he was not the kind to sit quietly and work meticulously.  So I asked him, ‘Richard, what are you doing?  I’ve told you not to play with this toy?’  He said, ‘I’m not playing with; I’m giving it to the crew.’  He was not giving it to the captain; he was giving it to the assistant.  I asked him why he was giving it to the assistant.  He said that the week before the assistant had told him, ‘Richard, you’re really fortunate with a father who loves you, with such a wealthy family and with so many toys to play with.  It’ll soon be my son’s birthday and I can’t afford to buy him a toy.’  When Richard had finished, I was silent for a while and then only said, ‘Wrap up the present nicely.’  Though I didn’t encourage him to do what he did, I was very pleased about what my son was doing.

There are things that might bring in a lot of money but I wouldn’t do.  A person has to be able to look beyond money.  As long as we can keep our dignity, life becomes more meaningful.

<BR>
In 1978, I returned to the mainland [China] for the first time after liberation.

<BR>
I think education is the most important thing to a nation.  Without good education, whatever equipment or plans you have mean nothing.  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Educated people are vital.

America owes 80% of it’s economic growth today to new inventions.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Life is short.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
From the business point of view, if one had invested in China in the 80’s, one would have had better conditions and returns than today.  Why didn’t I invest then?  I was afraid people might say Li had come to exploit.  That wouldn’t have been worth it.

A good system is of great importance.

[In 1997] I will not because of Oriental Plaza, lose interest or faith in investing in China.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997 on the university he founded] Education is different from business; I will never be discouraged.  In business, I can bring to an end something that is dissatisfying and has no future, but I will not do this to Shantou University.  Friends and colleagues said to me, ‘Mr Li, for a while, you were the only one caring about the university.  You put in the most time and the most care; you were the most anxious.’  By way of encouraging him, I said, ‘If the university were destroyed by a bomb tomorrow or demolished by an accident.  I would have it rebuilt.’  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
China in the past several hundred years… since Kangxi… has been weak because not enough respect has been given to industry and trade.  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s entrepreneurs who create and who, with marketing skills, make a nation wealthy.  Their contribution to a nation is definitely not less than that of scholars, farmers and workers.  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I remember reading a treatise by Sima Qian.  He says to trade is to fill the needs of the people.  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To me, intellectuals… whether they are in education or in technology, industrialists, entrepreneurs and politicians, they’re all an integral part of society.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Some people are learned and I should learn from them…
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Magazines like using my pictures on their overs hoping to increase circulation.  All this to me is hard to bear… a form of pressure.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The burden of poverty and this bitter taste of helplessness and isolation sort of branded on my heart forever the questions that still drive me. Is it possible to reshape one’s destiny? Is it possible to minimize challenges through lessening complexities? And is it possible to enhance chances for success through meticulous planning?
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On working hard at 70 years of age] First, it’s a challenge.  Second, I’m in charge of several listed companies and want to maximize profit for my shareholders.  When you are rich, you suddenly think of doing meaningful things in life, things you can do with money.   If you try to make money only when you need it, it’s very difficult.  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I personally hope to lessen my business workload in the coming years, but I will not be idle.  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In so many years, the site of Shantou University changed from desolate land to a campus of several million square feet.  I believe this will go on and will not disappear with time.  Equally meaningful things, big or small, I will never stop doing.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I find solace in my heart.  I think I’ve done many things that have required money, time and care for the good of other people and these things make me feel honoured and proud.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Businesspeople in general shouldn’t have an overly narrow view of their industry, [rather they] need a 360-degree perspective and to look at everything from all possible angles.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Set your goals high; make friends with different kinds of people; enjoy simple pleasures. Stand on high ground; sit on level ground; walk on expansive ground.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In the competitive world today, you give more in order to get more.  It’s like the Olympics.  Look at the runners that come home first.  The winner has won but he is just a bit faster than the first and second runners-up.  If it’s a sprint it may be less than a second, just a tiny bit.  You run a bit faster and win.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Children of wealthy families grow up in a greenhouse.  No matter it is a big tree or any plant, their roots are not strong.  If I spoil them, they’ll have a hard life ahead.  When they get a knock or run into hard times, they’ll be helpless.  
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I may not be very talented but I can say that I’m like a small tree that’s grown in storms and among rocks.  You go to the hills and see.  To uproot a little plant that’s grown among the rocks takes quite a bit of effort.
<BR><a href="li-ka-shing-quotes.html">Li Ka Shing<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When you think that life is but a short journey, you’ll hope to make the most of the time when you’re still able to work, to sow good seeds in the world.  This is worth doing.
