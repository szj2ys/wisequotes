You can’t cross a chasm in two small jumps.<BR><B>David Lloyd George</B><BR><BR>There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.<BR><B>Peter F Drucker</B><BR><BR>Each morning sees some task begun,Each evening sees it close.Something attempted, something done,Has earned a night’s repose.<BR><B>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</B><BR><BR>The reward of a thing well done, is to have done it.<BR><B>Ralph Waldo Emerson</B><BR><BR>God will not look you over for medals, degrees or diplomas, but for scars.<BR><B>Elbert Hubbard</B><BR><BR>No pains, no gains.<BR><B>Samuel Smiles</B><BR><BR>There are no gains without pains.<BR><B>Benjamin Franklin</B><BR><BR>You’ve got to go through the negative before you can get to the positive.<BR><B>Willard L Burson</B><BR><BR>There is no success without hardship.<BR><B>Sophocles</B><BR><BR>All things are difficult before they are easy.<BR><B>Thomas Fuller</B><BR><BR><BR><BR>I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed.<BR><B>Booker T Washington</B><BR><BR>Success is not measured by what a man accomplishes, but by the opposition he has encountered, and the courage with which he has maintained the struggle against overwhelming odds….<BR><B>Orison Swett Marden</B><BR><BR>The honor of the conquest is rated by the difficulty.<BR><B>Baron De Montesquieu</B><BR><BR>The measure of a man is the way he bears up under misfortune.<BR><B>Plutarch</B><BR><BR>The greater the obstacle, the more glory in overcoming it.<BR><B>Jean Baptiste Moliere</B><BR><BR>The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.<BR><B>Thomas Paine</B><BR><BR>To win without risk is to triumph without glory.<BR><B>Pierre Corneille</B><BR><BR>No pain, no palm; no thorns, no throne; no all, no glory; no cross, no crown.<BR><B>William Penn</B><BR><BR>It is certain that the greatest poets, orators, statesmen, and historians, men of the most brilliant and imposing talents, have labored as hard, if not harder, than day laborers; and that the most obvious reason why they have been superior to other men is that they have taken more pains than other men.<BR><B>Orison Swett Marden</B><BR><BR>The world is so constructed, that if you wish to enjoy its pleasures, you must also endure its pains.  Whether you like it or not, you cannot have one without the other.<BR><B>Swami Brahmananda</B><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>It is not ease but effort, not facility but difficulty, that makes men.  There is, perhaps, no station in life in which difficulties have not to be encountered and overcome before any decided measure of success can be achieved.<BR><B>Samuel Smiles</B><BR><BR>The battle of life is, in most cases, fought uphill; and to win it without a struggle were perhaps to win it without honour.  If there were no difficulties there would be no success; if there were nothing to struggle for, there would be nothing to be achieved.<BR><B>Samuel Smiles</B><BR><BR>He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little; he who would achieve much must sacrifice much….<BR><B>James Allen</B><BR><BR>You make up your mind before you start that sacrifice is part of the package.<BR><B>Richard M DeVOS</B><BR><BR>The most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle.  The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.<BR><B>Baron Pierre De Coubertin</B><BR><BR>Achievement must be made against the possibility of failure, against the risk of defeat.<BR><a href="ray-kroc-quotes.html">Ray Kroc<a/><BR><BR> It is no achievement to walk a tightrope laid flat on the floor.<BR><a href="ray-kroc-quotes.html">Ray Kroc<a/><BR><BR> Where there is no risk, there can be no pride on achievement and, consequently, no happiness. The only way we can advance is by going forward, individually and collectively, in the spirit of the pioneer.<BR><a href="ray-kroc-quotes.html">Ray Kroc<a/><BR><BR> Integrity is a hard-won achievement.<BR><a href="john-maxwell-quotes.html">John Maxwell<a/><BR><BR>Happiness doesn’t come from big pieces of great success but from small, daily achievements. What Mr (Benjamin) Franklin is saying is that we must be happy with what we’ve got when we’re in pursuit of what we really want. Abraham Lincoln said it best. He said, ‘You’ll be as happy as you make up your mind to be.’<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>It means that big achievements come one small step at a time. It means that you’ve got to enjoy the journey. It means that you must enjoy and take pride in your little accomplishments. It means celebrating who you are becoming in pursuit of your larger goal. And it mean’s doing so everyday.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>These three things, will power, work, and success, are the mainstays of human existence: will power opens the doors to brilliant and happy careers; work allows us to pass through them, and once we have run the course, success will crown our achievement.<BR><a href="louis-pasteur-quotes.html">Louis Pasteur<a/><BR><BR> The more we teach achievement at the expense of inner satisfaction, the more we teach youngsters to take the easier path and to avoid a failure label. Yet, when we take just a cursory look at greatness in any human being in any profession, we are looking at people who have failed, and failed, and failed again and again, learning something new each time.<BR><a href="wayne-dyer-quotes.html">Wayne Dyer<a/><BR><BR>Enthusiasm facilitates achievement.<BR><a href="john-templeton-quotes.html">John Templeton<a/><BR><BR> Happiness is not a tangible thing, it’s a byproduct – a byproduct of achievement.<BR><a href="ray-kroc-quotes.html">Ray Kroc<a/><BR><BR> The imagination is the workshop of the soul, where are shaped all the plans for individual achievement.<BR><a href="napoleon-hill-quotes.html">Napoleon Hill<a/><BR><BR>That which stifles personal initiative is definitely an enemy of individual achievement.<BR><a href="napoleon-hill-quotes.html">Napoleon Hill<a/><BR><BR>Don't be afraid to aim high when choosing your life's goal, for no matter how high you aim, your achievements may fall below it.<BR><a href="napoleon-hill-quotes.html">Napoleon Hill<a/><BR><BR>Don't mistake movement for achievement. It's easy to get faked out by being busy. The question is: Busy doing what?<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The important achievement of Apollo was demonstrating that humanity is not forever chained to this planet and our visions go rather further than that and our opportunities are unlimited. <BR><a href="neil-armstrong-quotes.html">Neil Armstrong<a/><BR><BR> <script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="achievement-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="achievement-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="achievement-quotes-3.html">3<a/> </p><p><BR>
