Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and I conquer and the whole Empire says, "Well done!"<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.  He wins his battles by making no mistakes.  Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.  Hence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>It is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. So much for tactical dispositions.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The control of a large force is the same in principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken—this is effected by manoeuvres direct and indirect.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>That the impact of your army may be like a grind stone dashed against an egg—this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away but to return once more.  There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.  There are not more than five primary colours, yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever be seen.  There are not more than five cardinal tastes, yet combinations of them yield more flavours than can ever be tasted.  In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack - the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of manoeuvres.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle - you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.  Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Energy may be likened to the bending of a cross bow; decision, to the releasing of the trigger.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline; simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>One who is skilful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something that the enemy may snatch at it.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals.  Hence his ability to pick out the right men and to utilise combined energy.  When he utilises combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.  Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle, will arrive exhausted.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.  By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.  <BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended. You can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.  Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does not know what to attack.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>O divine art of sublety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is to attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.  We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.  And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.  For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations againstUS.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.  But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succour the right, the right equally impotent to succour the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred li apart, arid even the nearest are separated by several li!<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved.  Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.   Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is super abundant and where it is deficient.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-7.html">7<a/> </p><p><BR>
