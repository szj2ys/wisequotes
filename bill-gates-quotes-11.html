If you could basically talk to your computer and say the information you wanted and it understood where to get it, that would be a lot simpler than clicking around like a madman.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you ask a question like, what is the fastest computer chip available, you won’t read about potato chips being delivered in fast trucks or something, because the semantics will be understood.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997] Our failures tend to result from markets being too small.  Microsoft Bob was a product a couple of years ago that used on-screen cartoon characters to carry out tasks for people.  Unfortunately, the software demanded more performance than typical computer hardware could deliver at the time and there wasn’t an adequately large market.  Bob died.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the Internet in 1997] The closest thing to it I can think of is the Gold Rush where everybody went off to find their fortune.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In high tech no one has a guaranteed position.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A couple of times a year I go away for a think week, during which I read books and other materials my colleagues believe I should see to stay up to date.  These materials often include Ph.D. theses exploring the frontiers of computer science.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In July 1985 to John Sculley, the then head of Apple] Apple must make Macintosh a standard.  But no personal computer company, not even IBM, can create a standard without independent support.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We believe that things that are standard should be neutrally managed and things that are a company’s products where that company is going to take the risks and get rewards, they should be clearly labeled that way.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We have a tremendous opportunity to enhance the ways we think and learn by taking advantage of technology.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Handwritten notes will be delivered by mail, and their rarity will give them even more meaning.  But eventually there won’t be many other kinds of paper trucked around.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You try to ride the incredible wave that’s coming.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997] The future of computing is the computer that talks, listens, sees, and learns.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Giving computers the trappings of intelligence will make them easier to use.  But it won’t mean they really think – yet.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It will take much longer before we can hook computers directly to our central nervous systems, so that images in our heads are expressed directly to a screen.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The balancing of individual liberties against the public’s right to know – will be a hot topic.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Americans can benefit from a better understanding of the Asian or European view of important cultural and scientific events, and vice versa.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Embrace change or it won’t happen.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Whenever somebody says to me, ‘You’ve got to meet my friend so-and-so; he’s the smartest guy ever,’ my defenses go up.  Most people are quick to conclude that someone or something they encounter personally is exceptional.  This is just human nature.  Everybody wants to know someone or something superlative.  As a result, people overestimate the merit of that to which they’ve been exposed.  So the fact that people called Warren Buffett unique didn’t impress me much.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Warren [Buffett] says if he’d been born a few thousand years ago, he’d probably have been some animal’s lunch.  But he was born into an age that has a stock market and rewards Warren for his unique understanding of the market.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Over time, most business assets will be affected by technology’s broad reach – although Gillette, Coca-Cola, and See’s [candy] should be safe.

<BR>
[In 1995 on Warren Buffett playing bridge online changing his attitude with regards to computers] For the first six months he would come home and play for hours on end.  Despite the fact that he had studiously stayed away from technology and technology investing, once he tried the computer; he was hooked.  Now, many weeks Warren uses on-line services more than I do.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his wealth] If I had some set idea of a finish line, don’t you think I would have crossed it years ago.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Even today, what interests me isn’t making money per se.  If I had to choose between my job and having great wealth, I’d choose the job.  It’s a much bigger thrill to lead a team of thousands of talented, bright people than it is to have a big bank account.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m pretty good at multiplication, but I never look at the stock price so I don’t know what number to multiply by.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1990] I don’t have any money; I have stock.  I own about 35 percent of the shares of Microsoft, and I take a salary of $175,000 a year.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I don’t think the rich get much credit for anything.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The company is a high-tech stock and high-tech stocks are volatile.  The price is not a reflection of the contribution we make.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On the HDTV in his bedroom not working when he first moved into his house.] It was just sitting there shining.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Ted Turner] I’m very glad [Turner] has given that billion dollars.  Certainly, my giving will be in the same league as Ted’s – and beyond.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1987] I’m in a phase for the next ten years where my work is my primary contribution.  The idea of funding other things is some time off.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1997] Since I was a kid, libraries have played an important role in my life.  In the past couple of years I have had the opportunity to visit many libraries and see firsthand how people are using personal computers and the Internet to do anything from looking for a job to researching a term paper.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I grew up during the Vietnam War, which among other things pitted one generation against another in the United States.  I’ve seen the turmoil that exists when one generation, or one portion of our society, perceives the world quite differently than another.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Giving away money in meaningful ways will be a main preoccupation later in my life – assuming I still have a lot to give away.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1995] Last week I went out to dinner.  Someone came up to me, asking me for money.  I wasn’t sure what to do.  Then he said that I should look up his home page, and gave me his URL.  I didn’t know if it was true or not, but it was such a good line I gave the guy five bucks.  So he may be a homeless person with a home page.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When I’m 35, I’ll get married.  [He got married when he was 38]
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On being asked why he got married] There’s some magic there that’s hard to describe, and I’m pursing that.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Interviews are often full of surprises.  Connie Chung once asked me to jump over a chair in my office.  I did that, too.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I love the idea that most nights I get a chance to go home early and see my young daughter…
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his 18 month old daughter] I can’t even say the word ‘computer’ in my house, because if she hears me say it, she’ll just start saying, ‘puter, puter, puter’ and she won’t do anything until I take her and let her play with that.  And that really is a lot of fun.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In my personal life I don’t set big goals.  I’m sure ten years from now, I’ll probably have a couple more kids, because I’m enjoying having a daughter who’s almost two years old now.  That’s the most fun thing I’ve ever done, and I look forward to more.
