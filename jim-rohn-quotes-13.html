There are probably about a thousand facts about an automobile, but you don't need them all to make a decision. About a half dozen will do.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Better understated than overstated. Let people be surprised that it was more than you promised and easier than you said.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>For effective communication, use brevity. Jesus said, "Follow me." Now that's brief! He could be brief because of all that he was that he didn't have to say.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You cannot speak that which you do not know. You cannot share that which you do not feel. You cannot translate that which you do not have. And you cannot give that which you do not possess. To give it and to share it, and for it to be effective, you first need to have it. Good communication starts with good preparation.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Effective communication is 20% what you know and 80% how you feel about what you know.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>What is powerful is when what you say is just the tip of the iceberg of what you know.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you just communicate, you can get by. But if you communicate skillfully, you can work miracles.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Don't mistake courtesy for consent.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It's so easy to make a mistake in language if you aren't careful. What if you meant to say, "What's troubling you?" and what you actually said was, "What's wrong with you?"<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Real persuasion comes from putting more of you into everything you say. Words have an effect. Words loaded with emotion have a powerful effect.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Be careful of using inside lingo on the outside world.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Take advantage of every opportunity to practice your communication skills so that when important occasions arise, you will have the gift, the style, the sharpness, the clarity, and the emotions to affect other people.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Communication is the ability to affect other people with words.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The more you know, the less you need to say.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't be afraid to borrow if someone else has said it well. Winston Churchill said, "The truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it and ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is." That's so well said. You could stay up all night and not think of that.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The best advice I ever came across on the subject of concentration is: Wherever you are, be there.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>When you work, work. When you play, play. Don't mix the two.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Give whatever you are doing and whoever you are with the gift of your attention.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>On the way to work, concentrate on the way - not on the work.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Pay attention. Don't just stagger through the day.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Debate refines a good idea. That's why we have two major parties in Congress. Somebody says, "I have a great idea for the country." We say, "Wonderful! Put it on the table. Let's debate." And we start the debate by questioning the guy who has this great idea. After the third question he says, "I withdraw my great idea. I forgot about those three questions."<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>There is plenty of time to argue with new ideas later. The key is to take careful notes first and debate second.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Always be willing to look at both sides of the argument. Understanding the other side is the best way to strengthen your own.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We need to teach our children how to debate the major life issues. Debate strengthens their beliefs and enables them to defend themselves against ideologies that are going to come their way.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Humans have the remarkable ability to get exactly what they must have. But there is a difference between a "must" and a "want."<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The best motivation is self-motivation. The guy says, "I wish someone would come by and turn me on." What if they don't show up? You've got to have a better plan for your life.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>When you know what you want, and you want it bad enough, you will find a way to get it.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Motivation alone is not enough. If you have an idiot and you motivate him, now you have a motivated idiot.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Without a sense of urgency, desire loses its value.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>One discipline always leads to another discipline.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Affirmation without discipline is the beginning of delusion.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>You don't have to change that much for it to make a great deal of difference. A few simple disciplines can have a major impact on how your life works out in the next 90 days, let alone in the next 12 months or the next 3 years.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>The least lack of discipline starts to erode our self-esteem.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>All disciplines affect each other. Mistakenly the man says, "This is the only area where I let down." Not true. Every let down affects the rest. Not to think so is naive.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Discipline is the foundation upon which all success is built. Lack of discipline inevitably leads to failure.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-16.html">16<a/>  </p><p><BR>
