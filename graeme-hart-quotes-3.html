[On comparing Burns Philip in 2003 to the other businesses he has invested in] What I enjoy in the food business is that it's got very similar characteristics to the other businesses I have invested in but I'm not hitting any glass ceilings I don't have a growth constraint as the sector is so much larger and you can operate on a global basis.

[On whether the turnaround of Burns Philip and the successful takeover of Goodman Fielder was part of a grand plan?] I'd be cautious about saying it was all part of a grand plan but we went into the food sector with an intention of building a significant food group and that's what we are doing.   As the years tick by the group develops and evolves.  And it's a fairly substantial group now.

[In 2003 on whether he had any reservations when Burns Philip stumbled five years ago] Nah nah nah nah. Burns Philp when we got in there was exactly what we wanted in terms of the underlying food businesses. There were some surprises because they hadn't given everybody the facts on a number of points and we had to work that out but that didn't alter the fundamentals of what we were doing. We just got stuck in, worked it out and moved on.

[On his wife saying in her 20s ‘If I could have one island, that would be the one I’d want.’ (Browns Island) – Then him buying the house next door which looks so close you’d think you could swim to it and saying] That’s as close as I can get you to your island.

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On an investor at a shareholders’ meeting suggesting that he should call in the receivers] Don’t even think about it.  What we have to do is to work our way through it and come out the other end with those businesses intact.
<BR><a href="graeme-hart-quotes.html">Graeme Hart<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is something about being surrounded by schooling hammerheads that gives me a real thrill.  I can’t get enough of it.

[In August 2006 on a $1.32 billion deal to take Burns Philip private] There are certain inefficiencies to be taken into account if we were to continue operating through two ownership structures.  On balance, we have concluded that it is timely to consolidate into one private structure.

It is a clear leader in its markets as a result of its broad product line and unique distribution system.  I am excited about the opportunity to grow Pactiv's foodservice and Hefty consumer businesses and to be associated with the people who have made it such a successful company over the years.
