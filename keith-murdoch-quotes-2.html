<BR>
I had three copies of the Final Sports and in none of them could I read the Golf Notes.

<BR>
<BR>
Our outlook should be consistently and aggressively good Australian.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To his wife Elisabeth Murdoch on their 10th year anniversary.] I can’t begin to explain how I feel about these ten happy years and all the wonderful things you have done for me and how really wonderful I think you are.  It is an amazing piece of luck for me that you were just you, because I could not have been happy with anyone else.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To his young wife Elisabeth when showing off his antique glass and china collection.] Do you like old things? [‘Oh yes, Sir Keith, I am very fond of you.’ – Elisabeth Murdoch] [She went on to outlive Sir Keith Murdoch by 60 years passing away in 2012 at the age of 103.]
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To Lyons in October 1935] I can understand a straight-out policy which aims at he severe limitation of [commercial radio] stations or a view to the building up of [government-funded ABC] stations.  [However] supposing that the policy is accepted of allowing [commercial] stations to continue the exceedingly progressive work they are now doing, what is to be gained by preventing their close cooperation?  It would be a good thing for Australia if there were chains of [commercial] stations… It is such a pity to see a government based on liberty for individual effort to do such a dreadful thing as this regulation, and do it in a wrong statement of facts.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 1931] It is difficult during a crisis which deeply affects the moral and physical welfare of the Australian people to maintain a perfect equilibrium in the management of newspapers.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 1931] Deep ethical principles are involved [and our papers] have been, to the best of their ability, sincere and open-minded in their policies, and scrupulously fair in their news columns.  Our duty is to the community as a whole [and] we will not pay special allegiance to any class or section, but will continue to endeavour to serve the best interests of the whole Nation…
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 1931] We have never interfered with the Labor activities of members of our staff, and we have open doors today as ever to Labor’s political and industrial leaders when they wish to use our columns.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 1931] The Herald and Weekly Times Limited is one of the most democratic companies in the country, being composed of 2200 small shareholders, including a great number of employees and women, and small trust estates.  We employ directly some 1200 adults, and indirectly thousands of others.  
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 1931] The rank and file of our employees are encourages to join Unions…
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[On creating a new company during financially depressing times in August 1933 – Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd as an amalgamation of The Brisbane Courier and The Daily Mail to create ‘The Courier-Mail.’] One of the many results of the financial stringency from which everyone in the community has suffered to a greater or lesser extent.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 1936] It is a very proud though for myself to carry through my life that no Herald or Sun employee had been allowed to go down during the depression, or to suffer hardship as a result of the distressful storm that has swept over the world.  
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 1936 at the age of 51 on seeing the thirty-two boys of the Old Brigade.] To see you here today makes me quite look forward to my own retirement.  The example of my own father, now 86 and still taking an interest in world affairs, journalism and his garden, has shown me how retirement broadens one’s outlook; once the immediate worry of business is lifted from a man’s shoulders he can see the world around him in a much clearer perspective.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 1939] This country has immense changes to make if it is to hold its place… We cannot expect Great Britain to be able to maintain the sea power in both hemispheres necessary for the protection of the whole Empire.  
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 1939 on Bob Menzies.  Many] Would accept Menzies as Prime Minister [and] in November this appeared likely.  But Bob has a curiously disconcerting way of discouraging adherence, whilst in fact eagerly seeking it.  He is a most difficult many to work for.  I do not know whether it is utter laziness or pride.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1936 on consuming locally made paper for newsprint.] At present we have a mission in America consulting the best experts in the design of a mill covering newsprint, craft papers and printing papers.  If the tests are satisfactorily completed, we should be moving forward before the end of this year with an initial unit sited in the Derwent Valley.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1938] The continued prosperity and security of the newspaper industry in Australia is the strongest motive behind the present effort to establish the newsprint industry, with the capital under the control of an association of newspaper companies…  
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1938] The establishment of newsprint manufacture in Australia must be a very valuable insurance for [newspaper workers] and for the newspaper industry generally against a recurrence of the drastic fluctuations in the overseas price of newsprint such as occurred around 1921.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[To Lionel Lindsay a perceptive art critic who was living in Sydney.] What chance is there of you settling near Melbourne for a year or two and trying with us to stir the dulled brain of this State with a wider appreciation of the beauties of life?  I could at once offer you the position of art critic of The Herald, and although this does not carry much payment, I think more could be made by additional writing.  What would you say to ten guineas a week for doing all the Art shows and Gallery work, and an extra article each week after consultation with the Editor or myself?… This City can be deeply stirred by good writing in the Arts.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1940] We want constructive criticism based on actualities.

<BR>
<BR>
The work of a newspaper is of paramount importance in a democracy in wartime…
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 1940] It is not an easy joy to find and stir the inner thoughts of men, or go deeper and try to touch the spirit.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On cutting through red tape.] I am still immersed in a labyrinth of invested interests which make it extremely difficult to be effective on any broad scale.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1940] I believe in the freedom of the press, and I am trying to preserve that freedom as against censorship.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 1940] We have to give an energetic, comprehensive, truthful picture of the calamities, the heroism, the issues, and above all the results of the events abroad and our own nation’s efforts.  Secondly, we must be fearless, constructive and informative in our comment; thirdly, we must have sympathy toward the individual war problems of staffs, and fourthly – and this is equally difficult – we have to adapt our own internal economy to a sudden drop in revenues, to the curtailment of overseas [newsprint supplies] and to high war costs…
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 1940] We do not claim that we have been all that we might have been in this period, but at least we have been one of the pillars of the community standing for the support of the upright, and the comfort of all.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In August 1942 on what he said in 1936 to leading Australian politicians.] We have two years to prepare; we must increase all our defence works, and have compulsory military service.  ‘Oh!’ They said, ‘but Australia will never vote for that.’
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 1942] We must find a way to strengthen the councils of Whitehall.  
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 1942] Things are wrong in this country that should be put right.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In February 1942] We must have a frank facing up to all the facts and a prompt examination of such incidents… so that lessons, if any, may be cleverly applied.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[In March 1942] We can save Australia.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In May 1942] They are being shackled too much.  The censorship up there seems to give them too many hurdles to jump.  The first hurdle is the field censorship, and it is a pretty big one.  At the same time it is encouraging and permitting very lavish stories of the battle, making it into a great victory, and really doing us great harm… The effect of it is to limit greatly the possibility of writing the truth, and to prevent many good and wholesome accounts from being published here or abroad.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 1942] Brave people carry on cheerfully, too proud and too good to harbor complaint.  Of such are the finest people in all sections of our nation.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1942] Faith is the greatest need of the nation today.  The faith in the good purpose of the world’s Creator.  Faith in the goodness of things that can be achieved.  Faith in the goodness of the heart that moves mountains.  Faith in the triumph of the righteous cause.  Faith in each other and faith in one’s self.  
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1942] Faith of this sort is vital to victory.  It is vital to the future greatness of our country.  It is the only road to those heights where victory lies.  It, together with the other things of great morale – unity and fortitude – are essential to the conditions which produce heroic efforts.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1942] I believe in the good purpose of life, in the beauty of the universe, and the high destiny of man.  I believe in the power of the spirit and the triumph of the good in heart.  
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In October 1942] I believe in a strong Australia, indivisible and free; in the righteousness of our cause and in the strength of a united nation to defeat our foes.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 1942] The aspirations which will impel a stirred nation towards the better domestic life will find themselves mixed with external pressures demanding that they also shall be considered in the policies of the nation.  The aim of statesmanship will be to combine these forces and use the double impulse for great courses… Surely it is clear now how isolationism placed us in appalling peril and by its insistence on unpreparedness is costing us much of our best blood.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In November 1942] Much must be done… to increase the proportion of wealth which passes to the workers and producers.  This is fundamental for three reasons: it is just, it tends to strengthen the lives of the majority, [and] it makes for national unity.
<BR><a href="keith-murdoch-quotes.html">Keith Murdoch<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In April 1942] All the world except Japan thinks we are doing better than we are.
