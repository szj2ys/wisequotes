A plow that scours.

<BR>
[In 1868] Almost every year, in our long experience, we have discovered and applied some new feature to our Plows, enhancing their value.

I cut the teeth off the mill-saw with a hand-chisel.  I cut a pattern out of paper for the moldboard and share.  I laid the pattern on the saw and cut out around it with a hand chisel, with the help of a striker and a sledge.  I then laid the piece on the fire of the forge and heated it, a little at a time, shaping it as best I could with the hand hammer.  After making the upright standards out of bar iron, I was ready for the wood parts.  I went out to the timber, dug up a sapling, and used the crooks of the roots for handles.  I shape the beat out of a stick of timber with an axe and a drawing-knife.  In this fashion, I succeeded in constructing a very rough plow.

[On hitching up his first plow.  ‘Want me to take her?’ – Lewis Crandall] I will, you drive.

[On a Bloomingville farmer saying ‘Self-polisher be damned!  There never was a plow that will sour in this prairie soil.’]  Stranger, where do you live?  [‘Up Bloomingville way’]  Will you take one of these plows home with you, and try it?  And if it does not scour, will you let me know?  I will send for it, and get it without any cost to you.  [‘Aye?

[On the John Deere Hawkeye Corn Cultivator] The best wheel corn cultivator in use.  Not in our opinion only, but in the estimation of all who have used it.  The only cultivator that will operate on hill sides.  So constructed as to conform to uneven surfaces.  Cannot be injured by coming in contact with hidden obstructions.  Will not clog in foul land.  Turns over the soil to or from the corn.  Governed entirely by the feet.  Has a side motion sufficient to plow the crookedest rows.  In moving side ways all of the shovels maintain the same relative position to each other, thus leaving no balks.  Has an advantage over all other Cultivators in the height of axles.  Of superior strength, workmanship and finish, easy draught and all downward pressure on the horses’ necks being obviated.  We send it forth, feeling confident it will ‘Hoe on its own now’, in such a manner as to bring no discredit on the manufacturers of the ‘Moline Plow.’ (John Deere Plow).

They haven't got to take what we make and somebody else will beat us, and we will lose our trade.
