<BR>
<BR>
You can’t hold up conditions artificially, and you can’t change the underlying laws of trade.  If you try, you must inevitably fail.
<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>

<BR><a href="john-rockefeller-quotes.html">John Rockefeller<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I ascribe the success of the Standard Oil Company to its consistent policy of making the volume of its business large through the merit and cheapness of its products.
