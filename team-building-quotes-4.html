<BR>
Wild ducks make a lot of noise, but they also have the sense to benefit from occasionally flying in formation.
<BR><B>Anonymous</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Remember upon the conduct of each depends the fate of all.
<BR><B>Alexander the Great</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The leaders who work most effectively, it seems to me, never say 'I.' And that's not because they have trained themselves not to say 'I.' They don't think 'I.' They think 'we'; they think 'team.' They understand their job to be to make the team function. They accept responsibility and don't sidestep it, but 'we' gets the credit.... This is what creates trust, what enables you to get the task done. 
<BR><B>Peter Drucker</B>
<BR>
<BR>
In union there is strength.
<BR><B>Aesop</B>
<BR>
<BR>
You put together the best team that you can with the players you've got, and replace those who aren't good enough.
<BR><B>Robert Crandall</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Teamwork divides the task and double the success.
<BR><B>Anonymous</B>
<BR>
<BR>
You will find men who want to be carried on the shoulders of others, who think that the world owes them a living. They don't seem to see that we must all lift together and pull together. 
<BR><B>Henry Ford</B>
<BR>
<BR>
None of us, including me, ever do great things. But we can all do small things, with great love, and together we can do something wonderful.
<BR><B>Mother Teresa</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The greater the loyalty of a group toward the group, the greater is the motivation among the members to achieve the goals of the group, and the greater the probability that the group will achieve its goals.
<BR><B>Rensis Likert</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. 
<BR><B>Helen Keller</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Teamplayer: Once who unites others toward a shared destiny through sharing information and ideas, empowering others and developing trust.
<BR><B>Dennis Kinlaw</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success.  You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime.
<BR><B>Babe Ruth</B>
<BR>
<BR>
[In AD 66] We trained hard, but it seemed every time we were beginning to form up into teams, we would be reorganized. I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency and demoralization.
<BR><B>Petronii Arbitri Satyricon</B> 
<BR>
<BR>
The achievements of an organization are the results of the combined effort of each individual.
<BR><B>Vince Lombardi</B>
<BR>
<BR>
There are few, if any, jobs in which ability alone is sufficient. Needed, also, are loyalty, sincerity, enthusiasm and team play.
<BR><B>William B Given Jr</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.
<BR><B>Mark Twain</B>
<BR>
<BR>
It’s easy to get good players. Getting them to play together, that’s the hard part.
<BR><B>Casey Stengel</B>
 <BR>
<BR>
The star of your team is the team. The star of the team is the team.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Unselfish team play and team spirit are two of the foremost essentials for our success.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Personal greatness is not determined by the size of the job, but by the size of the effort that one puts into the job. This applies to everyone on your team.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>

<BR>
<BR>
Each member of your team has the potential for personal greatness; a leader’s job is to teach them how to do it.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A leader defined by intensity is a stronger leader. A leader ruled by emotions is weak, the team vulnerable.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Be sure you acknowledge and give credit to a team mate who hits you with a scoring pass or for any fine play he may make.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Perfection doesn’t exist. Thus, actively be alert and looking for imperfections in your team and your competition. It is there. Find it.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Team Spirit means you are willing to sacrifice personal considerations for the welfare of the organization.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
The star of your team is the team. Both you and your organization must fully comprehend that fact.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
The best talent doesn’t always make the best team.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Teamwork means sharing—the ball, information, contacts, ideas.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
A basketball team that won’t risk mistakes will not outscore opponents. The same is true for any organization.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Sports teams are constantly adjusting during a game to what the opponent does. Do the same.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
<BR>
<BR>
Team spirit is one of the most tangible ‘intangibles’ I have ever encountered. It’s difficult to see; you feel it.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
You must discipline yourself to do what is expected of you for the welfare of the team. The coach has many decisions to make, and you will not agree with all of them, but you must respect and accept them. Without supervision and leadership and a disciplined effort by all, much of our united strength will be dissipated pulling against ourselves. Let us not be victimized by a breakdown from within.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Whether your team has talent to spare or is spare on talent, a leader’s goal remains the same; namely, you must bring forth the best from those with whom you work.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
A leader must accomplish the difficult task of getting those on the team to believe that “we” supersedes “me.”
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Punishment invokes fear. I wanted a team whose members were filled with pride, not fear.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
You don’t win a road race all on your own. You need your team-mates and you need the goodwill and cooperation of your competitors, too.
<BR><a href="lance-armstrong-quotes.html">Lance Armstrong<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Charlie Munger, our Vice Chairman, and I really have only two jobs. One is to attract and keep outstanding managers to run our various operations. [Other one is capital allocation] This hasn’t been all that difficult. Usually the managers came with the companies we bought, having demonstrated their talents throughout careers that spanned a wide variety of business circumstances. They were managerial stars long before they knew us, and our main contribution has been to not get in their way. This approach seems elementary: if my job were to manage a golf team – and if Jack Nicklaus or Arnold Palmer were willing to play for me – neither would get a lot of directives from me about how to swing.
<BR><a href="warren-buffett-quotes.html">Warren Buffett<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the reasons I have a team of advisors when I invest is simply that each person sees something different. After listening to what each person has to say, I then make up my own mind.
<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
A leader must be what he wants the team to become. Your example counts most.
<BR><a href="john-wooden-quotes.html">John Wooden<a/>
<BR>
<BR> 
Charlie and I know that the right players will make almost any team manager look good. We subscribe to the philosophy of Ogilvy and Mather’s founding genius, David Ogilvy: ‘If each of us hires people who are smaller than we are, we shall become a company of dwarfs. But, if each of us hires people who are bigger than we are, we shall become a company of giants.
