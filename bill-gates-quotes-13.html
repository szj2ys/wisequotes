I have always loved the competitive forces in this business.  You know I certainly have meetings where I spur people on by saying, ‘Hey, we can do better than this.  How come we are not out ahead on that?’  That’s what keeps my job one of the most interesting in the world.

<BR>
You can’t get people excited unless you can help them see and feel the impact.

[In 1981] 640k ought to be enough for anybody.

[On what an intelligent presence is] It’s an elusive concept.  There’s a certain sharpness, an ability to absorb new facts.  To walk into a situation, have something explained to you and immediately say, ‘Well, what about this?’  To ask an insightful question.  To absorb it real time.  A capacity to remember.  To relate to domains that may not seem connected at first.  A certain creativity that allows people to be effective.

The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>

<BR>
I’m just happy that the Crimson has called me ‘Harvard’s most successful dropout.’  I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class… I did the best of everyone who failed.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One of my biggest memories of Harvard came in January 1975, when I made a call from Currier House to a company in Albuquerque that had begun making the world’s first personal computers.  I offered to sell them software.  I worried that they would realize I was just a student in a dorm and hang up on me.  Instead they said: ‘We’re not quite ready, come see us in a month,’ which was a good thing, because we hadn’t written the software yet.  From that moment, I worked day and night on this little extra credit project that marked the end of my college education and the beginning of a remarkable journey with Microsoft.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What I remember above all about Harvard was being in the midst of so much energy and intelligence.

<BR>
[In 1996] Passionate leadership won’t succeed if contradictory signals are sent.  If you pump up your sales force at a meeting and tell them, ‘The most important goal is to make customers happy,’ you can’t go back the next day and say, ‘Your quota just got doubled so go out there and sell twice as much.’  If you send that kind of mixed message, your salespeople will know that all the talk about customer service was just talk and that the real priority is achieving the higher quota.

[In 1999] The successful companies of the next decade will be the ones that use digital tools to reinvent the way that they work.

A fundamental new rule for business is that the Internet changes everything.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The Internet is the first medium that allows anyone with reasonably inexpensive equipment to publish to a wide audience.  It is the first medium that distributes information globally at almost no marginal cost.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Reading off the screen is still vastly inferior to reading off of paper.  Even I, who have these expensive screens and fancy myself as a pioneer of this Web lifestyle, when it comes to something over about four or five pages, I print it out and carry it around with me and annotate.  And it’s quite a hurdle for technology to achieve to match that level of usability.

<BR>
[In 1995 on his young software programmers] If they want we will give them a sleeping bag, but there is something romantic about sleeping under the desk.  They want to do it.

In this business, by the time you realize you’re in trouble, it’s too late to save yourself.  Unless you’re running scared all the time, you’re gone.

Capitalism is this wonderful thing that motivates people, it causes wonderful inventions to be done.  But in this area of diseases of the world at large, it’s really let us down.

The original Microsoft Word was not very popular.  The user interface was a bit clunky… We kept improving it.  
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The path of innovation is - it`s more about system, where you start with the research, which gives you the breakthroughs and the customer needs, and you create products on a very regular basis that meet those needs.

[In December 2008] What holds back robotics?  It`s just software.

[In December 2008] I know that there are many things in the history of the company where we were absolutely the first, and we drove for - maybe even too early, things like tablet computing.
<BR><a href="bill-gates-quotes.html">Bill Gates<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The leader has advantages, in a software business, if you listen to your customers, if you invest properly in R&D, it should be fairly rare that the leader is replaced.

TV moving to the Internet.  It`s been almost 15 years now Microsoft has had a research group working on that.  That has been incredibly slow.
