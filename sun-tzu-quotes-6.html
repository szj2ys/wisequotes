Thus the skilful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.  He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.  By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he preventsthe enemy from anticipating his purpose.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.  He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and none knows whither he is going.  To muster his host and bring it into danger- this may be termed the business of the general.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion.  When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighbouring territory, you find yourself on critical ground. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.  When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.  When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground.  When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.  Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose. On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.   <BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defences.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat to make it seem that I mean to defend the position, whereas my real intention is to burst suddenly through the enemy's lines.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.  For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannothelp himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>We cannot enter into alliance with neighbouring princes until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country - its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>To be ignorant of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince.  When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.  Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Thus he is able to capture their cities and over-throw their kingdoms.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Confront your soldiers with the deed itself, never let them know your design. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes, but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.  For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that it is capable of striking a blow for victory.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy's purpose.  By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief.  This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries.  Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.  At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage-trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>In order to carry out an attack with fire, we must have means available; the material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.  The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Crossbar; for these four are all days of rising wind.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments: 1) When fire breaks out inside the enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without.  2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.  3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.  4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favourable moment. 5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.  A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.  In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.  Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.  Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.  But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.  Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labour.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honours and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.  One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.  Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.  <BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men.  Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: 1) Local spies; 2) inward spies; 3) converted spies; 4) doomed spies; 5) surviving spies.  When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover  the  secret system.  This is called "divine manipulation of the threads." It is the sovereign's most precious faculty.  Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district.  Having inward spies, making use of officials of the enemy.  Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies and using them for our own purposes.  Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our own spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.  Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp.  Hence it is that with none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. None should be more liberally rewarded.  In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.  They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.  Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Be subtle! Be subtle! And use your spies for every kind of business.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, the door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR>The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.  It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.  It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.  Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spycan be used on appointed occasions.<BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">Sun Tzu<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="sun-tzu-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="sun-tzu-quotes-7.html">7<a/> </p><p><BR>
