The successful investor is usually an individual who is inherently interested in business problems.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Doing what everyone else is doing at the moment, and therefore what you have an almost irresistible urge to do, if often the wrong thing to do at all.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Practical investors usually learn their problem is finding enough outstanding investments, rather than choosing among too many.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Usually a very long list of securities is not a sign of the brilliant investor, but of one who is unsure of himself.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There are fads and styles in the stock market just as there are in women’s clothes.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Conservative investors sleep well.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Constant leadership in engineering, not patents is the fundamental source of protection.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Never promote someone who hasn’t made some bad mistakes, because if you do, you are promoting someone who has never done anything.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is – almost never.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Investors have been so oversold on diversification that fear of having too many eggs in one basket has caused them to put far too little into companies they thoroughly know and far too much in others which they know nothing about.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
People operating in such a mental climate [negative war scare] are inclined to overlook some even more fundamental economic influences.  The results are always the same.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The wise investor can profit if he can think independently of the crowd and reach the rich answer when the majority of financial opinion is leaning the other way.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>

This matter of training oneself not to go with the crowd but to be able to zig when the crowd zags, in my opinion, is one of the most important fundamentals of investment success.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you can’t do a thing better than others are doing it, don’t do it at all.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>

<BR>
The need for patience if big profits are to be made from investment.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Nothing is worth doing unless it is worth doing right.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is a complicating factor that makes the handling of investment mistakes more difficult.  This is the ego in each of us.  
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
None of us likes to admit to himself that he has been wrong.  
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Go to five companies in an industry, ask each of them intelligent questions about the points of strength and weakness of the other four, and nine times out of ten a surprisingly detailed and accurate picture of all five will emerge.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Most people, particularly if they feel sure there is no danger of their being quoted, like to talk about the field of work in which they are engaged and will talk rather freely about their competitors.

Scuttlebutt.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe that the greatest long-range investment profits are never obtained by investing in marginal companies.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Investors… had best stay away from low profit-margin or marginal companies.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is not the profit margins of the past but those of the future that are basically important to the investor.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
When profit margins of a whole industry rise because of repeated price increases, the indication is not a good one for the long-range investor.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Those organizations where the top brass personally interfere with and try to handle routine day-to-day operating matters seldom turn out to be the most attractive type of investments.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It is the nature of business that in even the best-run companies unexpected difficulties, profit squeezes, and unfavorable shifts in demand for their products will at times occur.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If the right stocks are bought and held long enough they will always produce some profit.  However to produce close to the maximum profit… some consideration must be given to timing.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Forecasting is like trying to turn lead into gold.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If an investor had bought at the absolute lows, it would have been more a matter of luck than anything else.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we have made a mistake in buying a stock but can sell the stock at a small profit, we have somehow lost any sense of having been foolish.  On the other hand if we sell at a small loss we are quite unhappy about the whole matter.  
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
More money has probably been lost by investors holding a stock they really did not want until they could ‘at least come out even’ than from any other single reason.  If to these actual losses are added the profits that might have been made through the proper reinvestment of these funds if such reinvestment had been made when the mistake was first realized, the cost of self-indulgence becomes truly tremendous.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
What is most important… is that stocks are not bought in companies where the dividend pay-out is so emphasized that it restricts realizable growth.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t overstress diversification.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The disadvantage of having eggs in so many baskets that a lot of eggs do not end up in really attractive baskets, and it is impossible to keep watching all the baskets after the eggs are put in.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Buying a company without having sufficient knowledge of it may be even more dangerous than having inadequate diversification.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
An investor should always realize that some mistakes are going to be made…
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
He should take extreme care to own not the most, but the best.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In the field of common stocks, a little bit of a great many can never be more than a poor substitute for a few of the outstanding.
<BR><a href="philip-fisher-quotes.html">Philip Fisher<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Don’t be afraid of buying on a war scare.
