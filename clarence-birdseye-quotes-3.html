[Whilst fishing on mistakenly fighting for 30 minutes a penguin that he thought was an enormous fish and then having to tie his feet and rubber banding his sharp beak] To keep him from filling up on Indians’ toes.  [Later the penguin became a household pet]
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[His crayfish recipe] Shell the tails raw; split as for ‘fantail shrimp’; treat with salt, pepper and Lawry’s; and sauté in butter.
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Paramonga red peppers] Twice as hot as molten steel.
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In Paramonga in Peru] Shades of Labrador!  There a common winter meal consisted of salted capelin (a smelt-like sea fish) bread and tea.  This noon I watched Indians eating the same fodder – whole salted raw anchovies, bread and chica.  The later is the water in which dry red-kernelled corn has been boiled, and may be either unfermented or as heady as a good applejack.

[On parts of Peru in 1954] Mother and I couldn’t help contrasting the pioneering of this group in what only five or ten years ago was about the wildest area in the world, with our early experiences.  Even in the summer it took us from two to three weeks to get from any large city to our Cartwright headquarters; in winter a 1200-mile trip by dog team was our only means of leaving Labrador.  These folks pass from Iquitos on the Amazon to Lima between breakfast and lunch.  We had no communication with the ‘outside’ from November 15 to June 15.  These people have constant radio communication with Lima, Rio de Janeiro and the United States.  Our nearest doctor was 250 miles away by dogsled.  They have a resident doctor, a hospital, 3 schools, a postman at their headquarters.  We used wood-burning stoves and kerosene and melted snow for our winter water supply.  They have a central power plant, refrigerators, electric stoves, and even the remotest outpost has its generator and two-way radio.  Ho, hum!  The world, even the jungle, does move doesn’t it?

[On continuous change] Ho, hum!  The world, even the jungle, does move doesn’t it?

<BR>
<BR>
[On maintaining the quality of fish fingers in 1955] I believe the big danger to it is a drop in quality standards, which can kill a good thing almost overnight.  This is not a new idea by any means, but it still holds true.
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1955-1956 before he passed away on October 7, 1956] Still other ventures are afoot, and the days are not long enough for me to take advantage of all the opportunities I see.
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I did not discover quick-freezing.  The Eskimos had used it for centuries, and scientists in Europe had made experiments along the same lines I had.  What I accomplished… was merely to make packaged quick frozen food available to the public.
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Fish and caribou meat, chilled rapidly in the frosty air, were tender and fresh-flavored when cooked – though frozen for months.  Why couldn’t fruits, vegetables and other foods be preserved the same way?
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[Being modest on the method and business he built up.] Nothing very remarkable about what I had done…
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1917 on a eight-year struggle to find a commercially practical method of quick freezing, a mechanical way to] Reproduce the Labrador winters in New England.
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[His method] Quick freeze.

<BR>
[After selling his company for $22 million to General Foods] All my life I have desired a Packard 8 car and that property.  Now I have them.
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Birds Eye Fish advertising] Frozen with the wiggle in its tail.
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On Birds Eye spinach advertising] Washed, no sand!
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Go around asking a lot of damn fool questions and taking chances.  Only through curiosity can we discover opportunities, and only by gambling are we able to take advantage of them.
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In 1943] Food shortages in the United States are so acute that in some states we are already eating horse meat, and in Oklahoma a state official urges that we eat crows, which he says, ‘Taste like roast duck.’
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Just because something has always been done in a certain way is never a sufficient reason for continuing to do it that way.
<BR><a href="clarence-birdseye-quotes.html">Clarence Birdseye<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
There is always a better way of doing almost everything.
