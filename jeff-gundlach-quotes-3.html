[In June 2013.] People don't like negative return obviously but when you have negative returns in every category of bond funds it is not difficult to tell your clients because you are preserving capital better than many other funds.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2013.] We were basically forced to start our own company overnight.  We learned as we went along. I never had to deal with the formulation of a company… I only really knew about 60% maybe of the totality of what it took to run a company, but we basically learned the other 40% over about a three-month time period.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2013.] We didn't take the lowest-cost route. We spent substantially more than average, because we were trying to make it work in a compressed time frame.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2013.] I don't believe in keeping employees edgy or unhappy.  You try to be positive about what they are doing.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In June 2013.] I never thought that we would fail… I didn't even entertain the idea of failure, because it's just not a productive activity.  Every minute that you spend fretting over success or failure is a minute that you're not working the business.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2013.] I made the most dangerous prediction in July 2012. I said we are putting in the low for the 10-year Treasury. That's the one that everyone has been wrong on for 20 years. But yields did bottom out at 1.4% in July 2012; now they are at 2.7%. However, I'm actually less convinced today that this was the low in interest rates than I was then.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2013.] Take a look at Norway if you want to see a country that really looks out of whack. The housing market there has been so strong, and the debt ratios are so high. People don't think about Norway as being that type of a country. But if you look at the charts, it is pretty remarkable.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2013.] People used to get married and start having a family when they were 21, 22 years old. Now, it is a lot older than that, and young people are burdened with student-loan debt, which makes it that much more difficult to carry a mortgage.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2013.] You don't make money in housing very easily.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2013.] What people don't want currently is interest-rate risk. People are absolutely freaking out about interest-rate risk. So if you're willing to take the interest-rate [risk at the long end of the curve], you can get yields of 11% in the agency mortgage market. We have some of that in our various funds.

<BR> 
[In September 2014 on discussing with Bill Gross whether he would want to be ‘No 2’ at DoubleLine but him also openly discussing with another firm at the same time.] It was an intriguing idea. I am sort of glad he made his decision for me. 
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2014.] One of the things we understand about the mortgage 
market is that there are often mispricings that occur. 
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In December 2014.] It’s hard to see the Fed raising rates when Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is lower now than in 2012 when they started QE3, job growth has been irregular, wages as a percent of GDP have not moved higher, average hourly earnings growth has not risen and purchasing power has dropped 3-4% since 2007. 
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2015 on Bill Gross.]  He navigated Total Return magnificently during the 2008 credit crisis, for example
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2015 on oil prices.] When you have a market that showed extraordinary stability for five years-trading consistently at $90 [a barrel] or above-undergo a catastrophic crash like this one, prices usually go down a lot harder and stay down a lot longer than people think is possible.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2015.] Everybody worried about what would happen to the U.S. government [bond] market when the Fed ended [its third round of quantitative easing] last fall and stopped its heavy monthly government bond purchases.  The answer, of course, is that foreign buying easily replaced declining government support of the market. And the strengthening dollar, which we think will continue, only makes U.S. bonds all the more attractive, for not only do foreign investors benefit from higher relative rates, but they also win on currency translation profits.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2015.] The boost to U.S. consumers from lower pump prices is the first shoe to drop, but the negative secondary effects from the crude-oil price collapse take longer to surface.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2015.] Look, commodity prices have fallen back to their lows of 2009, which of course was at the height of the financial crisis. Something is obviously very wrong these days in the global economy.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2015.] Folks in Europe are obviously losing confidence and scared if they are willing to pay Germany for the privilege of parking their funds there.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2015.] Margin debt is near record highs. In other words, that means traders are borrowing record amounts of money to bid up stocks. This makes the market sensitive to sell-offs.

<BR>
<BR> 
[In January 2015.] If oil falls to around $US40 a barrel, then I think the yield on 10-year Treasury notes is going to 1 per cent.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2015.] When you have oil prices staying where they are for several months - which is likely, because that is a policy decision that some oil producers have made - some of these companies will start to really run into financial troubles.
<BR><a href="jeff-gundlach-quotes.html">Jeff Gundlach<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In January 2015.] US stocks have never rallied seven years in a row, and we’ve just entered year seven of the current bull run.
