As the twentieth year approaches, the possibility of a market crash increases.  After the crash, the stock market tends to stay down for ten years.  During the ten years the stock market is down, commodities such as gold, silver, oil and property dominate the investment world.  And every five years, there is some kind of major disaster.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The best part of playing the game of money, regardless of whether I was winning or losing, is that I got better at the game.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Teaching is one of the best ways of learning.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Prepare for bad times and you will only know good times.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Many people are financially struggling today because they are simply too slow – they cannot make money faster than the banks are printing it.  When it comes to financial transactions, most people are still in the stone age, getting paid by the hour, by the month, or per transaction, working for commissions, as is the case with real estate agents or stock brokers.  Those who will succeed in the future will be entrepreneurs who understand how quickly business and money are changing, and who have the ability and flexibility to quickly change and adapt.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>My poor dad was crushed by the new economy.  He choose financial security rather than financial freedom – and in the end, he had neither.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Today, businesses can do more business with fewer employees and thus become more profitable.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>This is the best of times for those willing to study, learn quickly, work hard … learn from the past to succeed in the future.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>If you are going to be financially secure, you need to learn to have more cash flowing into your pockets.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Rather than use net worth, I use cashflow to measure my wealth.  The money my investments bring in every month is true wealth – not some perceived notion of value that may or may not be true.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The secret to Rich Dad’s success was that he invested for cashflow.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Investing for capital gains is gambling.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Invest for cashflow and you’ll never worry about money.  Invest for cashflow, and you will not be wiped out in boom and bust markets.  Invest for cashflow and you’ll be a rich man.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Don’t let greed and easy money interfere with becoming a rich and financially wise man.  Never confuse capital gains with cashflow.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Rich people have money.  Wealthy people have time.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="1337074633";google_ad_width=468;google_ad_height=60;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>Cashflow investing requires more financial sophistication.  Anyone can buy something and hope the price will increase.  Finding cash-flowing deals take knowledge of both potential income and expenses, and how to project the performance of the investment based on those variables.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>If you want to change your life, begin by changing your words, and the best news of all is that words are free.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The concept ‘Live below your means’ keeps many people financially poor, emotionally empty, and spiritually neutral.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Were is not for his dreams, my rich dad would never have become a rich man.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Take away a person’s dreams, and you take away their life.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Rather than live below my means, rich dad reminded me constantly to push the boundaries of my life.  Even when I was short on money, I still drove a nice car and lived in a beachfront condo.  Rich dad’s advice was never to think, look or act like a poor person.  He constantly reminded me that ‘the world treats you as you treat yourself.’<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>When you don’t have money, think and use your head.  Never give in to the poor person inside of you.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Why live below your means when an abundant and full life is within your reach.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>In the world of money the rich are sellers and the poor and middle class are buyers.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Focus more on selling and less on buying.  The reason so many millions of people are in financial trouble is because they love to buy and hate to sell.  If you want to be rich, you must sell much more than you buy.  This does not mean you should live below your means.  Rather than live below your means, learn to sell, and you can expand your means and go for your dreams.  If you sell more than you buy, you will not have to live below your means or cling to job security.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>If a person’s life lacks integrity and is out of alignment with his mission in life, problems will occur.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The road to success is always under construction.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Expanding your means rather than living below your means.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>We can change ourselves by changing the way we think and what we study.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>The primary reason most people are afraid of changing is because they are afraid of making mistakes.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>It is hard to feel like a loser as long as cash is flowing into your pockets even if your asset price has depreciated.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>One reason why financially educated people want to keep their money moving is because if they park their money in one asset class, as many amateur investors do, they may lose their money when cash flows out of that asset class.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Legal advice that prevents you from getting into trouble with the law is always less expensive than legal advice once you are in trouble.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>As I’ve travelled, I’ve compared Americans to people in the emerging nations.  I’ve noticed a market difference in intensity and attitude towards learning about money.  Rather than focus on financial education, most Americans focus on going back to school to get a high paying job… at the same time our jobs are being exported to lower wage countries.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR>Most of us know that goals are important.  I’m sure that most of us know that people who make the effort to write down their goals are more successful than people who don’t.  If this is true, I wonder why people don’t focus more on their goals?  I believe the spiritual nature of goal setting has allowed Kim and I to live a life far beyond our wildest dreams.<BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">Robert Kiyosaki<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="robert-kiyosaki-quotes-6.html">6<a/> </p><p><BR>
