<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Some people say that failure should be avoided at all costs.  But if you think it through, that cost is too high.  The only way to avoid failure at all costs is to do nothing.  Although you avoid failure and defeat by doing nothing, you also avoid success and fulfillment.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>

<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>

<BR>
All enduring success must be grown from the inside out.  A feeling of inner success is much more difficult to acquire than material success.  It demands self-honesty and the realization that success is not constant.  It must be continually renewed through the seasons.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Failure is delay, not defeat.  It is a temporary detour, not a dead-end street.  Regard it as a short-term phenomenon.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Contemporary psychologists agree that setbacks and failures mean little in themselves.  The meaning of any failure - or any success, for that matter – is in how we take it and what we make of it.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Successful people shape their dreams into specific goals and action plans.  They have a sense of direction.  They know where they are headed.  Furthermore, they project dreams and goals into time.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Successful people work their plans.  They exert effort, adapt and persevere until their goals are reached.  They develop the skills needed for planting and replanting and cultivating until they reap the harvest they desire.  They put in the time required.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
To make life breathe easier for one person every day is to make a worthwhile start toward a destination that we can never fully reach but will be a process that gives meaning to our existence.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Perseverance maintains you through the passing of time.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Winter is the season for dreaming and planting.  Spring is the season for planting.  Summer is the season for growing and cultivating.  Autumn is the season for harvesting and dispersing.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The seasons ALWAYS come in sequence.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
One cannot ‘harvest’ life’s rewards without first planting seeds.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The wise person celebrates success rather than tries to capture it forever.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Happiness is the natural fruit of living a worthwhile life – regardless of one’s status, material possessions, or external appearance.  Our success must include bringing benefit to others.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Do you have a dream for your life?
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We need the sunlight of dreams to warm us and to compel us to grow upward and outward through what we plan, learn, do and achieve.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
If you don’t have a dream, you won’t develop goals.  In fact you’ll have no need for them.  If you don’t have goals, you’ll have no need for mapping out plans for reaching them.  You’ll have no need for additional training or experience to accomplish them nor will you discipline yourself to acquire new habits necessary for attaining them.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Goals should be flexible; Goals should be motivating.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Henri Matisse created some of his best work when he was aged, bedridden and nearly blind.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Face down the fear of taking a risk to improve your life.  The fear of taking a risk is far more responsible for keeping people from failure than getting a dose of bad luck.
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Plan for rewards – ‘As you make plans for reaching goals, include plans for a reward once a goal is reached.  Rewards allow you to celebrate your way to the goal.’
<BR><a href="denis-waitley-quotes.html">Denis Waitley<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Motivation without a goal is unfocused, is diffused, and evaporates easily.  However, when motivation becomes focused on a well-defined goal and game plan, it becomes a powerful force for success and achievement.
