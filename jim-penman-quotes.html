<BR>
What’s the point of owning a mower to mow just one lawn?
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I started my first business at the age of eight.
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>

<BR>
<BR>
I… worked in the public service for six months doing clerical work and learnt that it is the most unbelievably inefficient organization imaginable.  That’s what happens when owners of the organization aren’t involved.
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
In business, all anyone cares about is whether you’re good at what you do and whether you look after people.  In the academic world, they reject you if you’re too radical.
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
The mowing business just happened.
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I learnt more from mowing lawns than I ever did doing a PhD in history.  It taught me how to work hard and look after clients…
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You never get anywhere with something if you don’t like it.
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When I finished university after 10 years – I was 28 – I thought, ‘What can I do?’ and decided to mow lawns for a while.  I just wanted to build – something, anything.  I never thought that success could come out of gardening.
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
It was all a bit unorthodox in my parents’ eyes.  Doing an arts degree wasn’t exactly wasn’t exactly they had in mind, and then leaving it all behind to become a gardener was almost too much for my father.  He was quite horrified.  Just before he died a few years ago, I said to him: ‘It hasn’t been such a bad career choice after all, has it?’  He said: ‘I guess not.’
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My mother was always very supportive… She believe in me, even when no one else did.  She thought that no matter what I did, I would be successful.
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I always believed I would be successful.  I can’t imagine not being successful.
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I became lazy, ill-disciplined and ‘up myself’… To make matters worse, I’d fallen seriously in love and pined for my girlfriend when we were apart.  Business went downhill and I had to borrow tens of thousands of dollars to stay afloat.  I engaged a salesman to sell off my customer base to clear my debts.  He took the money and disappeared, just before Christmas in 1982.  I was 30 years old and a failure.
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I was 30 years old and a failure… True, I had been cheated, but a less lazy person would not have let it happen.  I felt that I had no talent for business and probably not much else either.  I got married and my life changed.
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Nothing in lawnmowing is particularly bad.  You can get covered with muck and get thirsty and hot and tired, but that’s about it.  The only drawback with gardening is that it can be boring if you do too much of it.
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I always did what the client asked me, even when I knew it was wrong, like cutting the grass too short.  Your job is to make a person’s garden look the way they want it to look.
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I’m not an expert gardener.
<BR><a href="jim-penman-quotes.html">Jim Penman<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My quoting was wrong, many of my attitudes were wrong.  Still, my instincts were right.
