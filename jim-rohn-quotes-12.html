That's what America is all about - "I" (individual) and "all" (all of us). When all of us understand how valuable each of us is, that's powerful. And here's what else is powerful: When each of us understands how powerful all of us are.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>America is unique because it offers you an economic ladder to climb. And here's what's exciting: It is the bottom of the ladder that is crowded, not the top.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>In America we have the greatest chance for opportunity than anyone else in the past six and a half thousand years. Never in recorded history have so many different gifts been brought from all over the world and deposited in one country.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>In America, everything you need to succeed is within reach.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Asking is the beginning of receiving. Make sure you don't go to the ocean with a teaspoon. At least take a bucket so the kids won't laugh at you.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>There is no better opportunity to receive more, than to be thankful for what you already have. Thanksgiving opens the windows of opportunity for ideas to flow your way.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>I resolve says, "I will." The man says, "I will climb this mountain. They told me it is too high, too far, too steep, too rocky, and too difficult. But it's my mountain. I will climb it and you will soon see me waving from the top or dead on the side from trying."<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Disgust and resolve are two of the emotions that lead to change.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Success is neither magical nor mysterious. Success is the natural consequence of consistently applying basic fundamentals.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>There are no new fundamentals. You've got to be a little suspicious of someone who says, "I've got a new fundamental." That's like someone inviting you to tour a factory where they are manufacturing antiques.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines, practiced every day; while failure is simply a few errors in judgement, repeated every day. It is the accumulative weight of our disciplines and our judgements that leads us to either fortune or failure.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Most homes valued at over $250,000 have a library. That should tell us something.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Everything you need for your better future and success has already been written. And guess what? It's all available. All you have to do is go to the library. But would you believe that only three percent of the people in America have a library card. Wow, they must be expensive! No, they're free. And there's probably a library in every neighborhood. Only three percent!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Miss a meal if you have to, but don't miss a book.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Some people claim that it is okay to read trashy novels because sometimes you can find something valuable in them. You can also find a crust of bread in a garbage can, if you search long enough, but there is a better way.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Some people read so little they have rickets of the mind.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It isn't what the book costs; it's what it will cost if you don't read it.                                             <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>I now have one of the better libraries. I’ll admit that I haven't read everything in my library, but I feel smarter just walking in it.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Books are easy to find and easy to buy. A paperback these days only costs six or seven dollars. You can borrow that from your kids!<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't just read the easy stuff You may be entertained by it, but you will never grow from it.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="8245691520";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR><BR>The book you don't read won't help.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>My father taught me to always do more than you get paid for as an investment in your future.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Whether you stay six weeks, six months, or six years, always leave it better than you found it.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't bring your need to the marketplace, bring your skill. If you don't feel well, tell your doctor, but not the marketplace. If you need money, go to the bank, but not the marketplace.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We get paid for bringing value to the marketplace. It takes time to bring value to the marketplace, but we get paid for the value, not for the time.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Here's the major problem with going on strike for more money: You cannot get rich by demand.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you make a sale, you can make a living. If you make an investment of time and good service in a customer, you can make a fortune.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't just let your business or your job make something for you; let it make something of you.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Lack of homework shows up in the marketplace as well as in the classroom<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Where you start in the marketplace is not where you have to stay.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><BR><BR>The worst days of those who enjoy what they do are better than the best days of those who don't.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>I used to say, "I sure hope things will change." Then I learned that the only way things are going to change for me is when I change.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Don't say, "If I could, I would." Say, "If I can, I will."<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>It doesn't matter which side of the fence you get off on sometimes. What matters most is getting off. You cannot make progress without making decisions.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>We generally change ourselves for one of two reasons: inspiration or desperation.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>If you don't like how things are, change it! You're not a tree.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>One of the best places to start to turn your life around is by doing whatever appears on your mental "I should" list.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Indecision is the thief of opportunity.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Every life form seems to strive to its maximum except human beings. How tall will a tree grow? As tall as it possibly can. Human beings, on the other hand, have been given the dignity of choice. You can choose to be all or you can choose to be less. Why not stretch up to the full measure of the challenge and see what all you can do?<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR>Decision making can sometimes seem like inner civil war.<BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">Jim Rohn<a/><BR><BR><script type="text/javascript">google_ad_client="ca-pub-5651930359888243";google_ad_slot="6151475651";google_ad_width=336;google_ad_height=280;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script><BR> <BR><a href="jim-rohn-quotes.html">1<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-2.html">2<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-3.html">3<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-4.html">4<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-5.html">5<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-6.html">6<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-7.html">7<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-8.html">8<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-9.html">9<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-10.html">10<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-11.html">11<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-12.html">12<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-13.html">13<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-14.html">14<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-15.html">15<a/> <a href="jim-rohn-quotes-16.html">16<a/>  </p><p><BR>
