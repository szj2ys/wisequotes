[In July 2010] I’m convinced that in many cases for-profit models 
improve the world more than philanthropy models if they can be made to work.
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>

One of the great things about the for-profit model is it’s self-
sustaining and it draws competition.

[On being told at age 10 that his father Mike was not his natural father.] It’s a fine truth to have out there.  I’m not embarrassed by it.  As far as I’m concerned, my Dad is my natural father.  The only time I ever think about it, genuinely, is when a doctor asks me to fill out a form.
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[When he was in high school on helping his Grandfather fix the ranches big D6 Caterpillar dozer when in the middle of no-where by reading three feet high of mail-order manuals.] You have to have a lot of patience.

<BR>
<BR>
[In 1981 at the age of 17 working at McDonalds] They wouldn’t let me anywhere near the customers.  This was my acned-teenager stage… One of the things that’s really fun about working at McDonald’s is to get really fast at all of this stuff.  See how many eggs you can crack in a period of time and still not get any shell in them.
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On his first business – (a summer-education camp) venture in 1982 at the age of 18.] We don’t just teach them something.  We ask them to apply it.
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>

<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe in this new technology and I’m going to show you how it’s going to work.

<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
You have to keep in mind, that human beings aren’t good at understanding exponential growth.  It’s just not something we see in our everyday life.
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[In leaving his job to go form Amazon.] I knew that when I was eighty there was no chance that I would regret having walked away from my 1994 Wall Street bonus in the middle of the year.  But I did think there was a chance that I might regret significantly not participating in this thing called the Internet, that I believed passionately in.  I also knew that if I tried and failed, I wouldn’t regret it.
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
My grandfather looked at me, and after a bit of silence, he gently and calmly said, ‘Jeff, one day you'll understand that it's harder to be kind than clever.’
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice.
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
Gifts are easy -- they're given after all. Choices can be hard. You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you're not careful, and if you do, it'll probably be to the detriment of your choices.
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
We humans - plodding as we are - will astonish ourselves.
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>

[In May 2010] I got the idea to start Amazon 16 years ago. I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles - something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world - was very exciting to me. I had just turned 30 years old, and I'd been married for a year.
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
As a young boy, I'd been a garage inventor. I'd invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn't work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings. I'd always wanted to be an inventor…

I was working at a financial firm in New York City with a bunch of very smart people, and I had a brilliant boss that I much admired. I went to my boss and told him I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet. He took me on a long walk in Central Park, listened carefully to me, and finally said, ‘That sounds like a really good idea, but it would be an even better idea for someone who didn't already have a good job.’
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
[On leaving his job and starting Amazon.] It really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing.  And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all.
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>

Will you play it safe, or will you be a little bit swashbuckling?
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

When it's tough, will you give up, or will you be relentless?
<BR><a href="jeff-bezos-quotes.html">Jeff Bezos<a/>
